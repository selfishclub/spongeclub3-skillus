# Agent Flow

Real-time visualization of Claude Code and Codex agent orchestration. Watch your agents think, branch, and coordinate as they work. [Demo video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud6eDrFN-TA).

## Why Agent Flow?

I built Agent Flow while developing [CraftMyGame](https://craftmygame.com), a game creation platform driven by AI agents. Debugging agent behavior was painful, so we made it visual. Now we're sharing it.

Claude Code is powerful, but its execution is a black box — you see the final result, not the journey. Agent Flow makes the invisible visible:

- **Understand agent behavior** — See how Claude breaks down problems, which tools it reaches for, and how subagents coordinate
- **Debug tool call chains** — When something goes wrong, trace the exact sequence of decisions and tool calls that led there
- **See where time is spent** — Identify slow tool calls, unnecessary branching, or redundant work at a glance
- **Learn by watching** — Build intuition for how to write better prompts by observing how Claude interprets and executes them

## Features

- **Live agent visualization**: Watch agent execution as an interactive node graph with real-time tool calls, branching, and return flows
- **Claude Code + Codex**: Auto-detects sessions from both runtimes concurrently and shows them side-by-side, or restrict to one via the `agentVisualizer.runtime` setting
- **Claude Code hooks**: Lightweight HTTP hook server receives events directly from Claude Code for zero-latency streaming
- **Codex rollout tailing**: Reads `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` (respects `CODEX_HOME`) and surfaces tool calls, reasoning, and authoritative token counts from Codex's own event stream
- **Multi-session support**: Track multiple concurrent agent sessions with tabs
- **Interactive canvas**: Pan, zoom, click agents and tool calls to inspect details
- **Timeline & transcript panels**: Review the full execution timeline, file attention heatmap, and message transcript
- **JSONL log file support**: Point at any JSONL event log to replay or watch agent activity

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (no VS Code required)

```bash
npx agent-flow-app
```

This starts the visualizer in your browser. Start a Claude Code session in another terminal — events will stream in real-time.

Options:
- `--port <number>` — change the server port (default: 3001)
- `--no-open` — don't open the browser automatically
- `--verbose` — show detailed event logs

### Standalone Web App (from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patoles/agent-flow.git
cd agent-flow
pnpm i
pnpm run setup      # configure Claude Code hooks (one-time)
pnpm run dev        # start the web app + event relay
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and start a Claude Code session in another terminal — events will stream to the browser in real-time.

### VS Code Extension

1. Install the extension
2. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **Agent Flow: Open Agent Flow**
3. Start a Claude Code or Codex session in your workspace — Agent Flow will auto-detect it

Agent Flow automatically configures Claude Code hooks the first time you open the panel. To manually reconfigure, run **Agent Flow: Configure Claude Code Hooks** from the Command Palette.

### Runtime selection

By default Agent Flow watches both Claude Code (`~/.claude/projects/`) and Codex (`~/.codex/sessions/`) concurrently in all three entry points (VS Code extension, `pnpm run dev`, `npx agent-flow-app`). Sessions are shown side-by-side and tagged by runtime. If you only use one, the other is a harmless no-op — no visible effect, no user action needed.

To restrict to one runtime:

- **VS Code extension:** set `agentVisualizer.runtime` to `"auto"` / `"claude"` / `"codex"` in your settings
- **`pnpm run dev` and `npx agent-flow-app`:** set the `AGENT_FLOW_RUNTIME` environment variable to `claude` or `codex` (defaults to watching both)

For non-default Codex installs, set the `CODEX_HOME` environment variable.

### JSONL Event Log

You can also point Agent Flow at a JSONL event log file:

1. Set `agentVisualizer.eventLogPath` in your VS Code settings to the path of a `.jsonl` file
2. Agent Flow will tail the file and visualize events as they arrive

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Agent Flow: Open Agent Flow` | Open the visualizer panel |
| `Agent Flow: Open Agent Flow to Side` | Open in a side editor column |
| `Agent Flow: Connect to Running Agent` | Manually connect to an agent session |
| `Agent Flow: Configure Claude Code Hooks` | Set up Claude Code hooks for live streaming |

## Keyboard Shortcut

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+Alt+A` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Alt+A` (Win/Linux) | Open Agent Flow |

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `agentVisualizer.runtime` | `"auto"` | Which agent runtime(s) to watch: `"auto"` (both), `"claude"`, or `"codex"` |
| `agentVisualizer.devServerPort` | `0` | Development server port (0 = production mode) |
| `agentVisualizer.eventLogPath` | `""` | Path to a JSONL event log file to watch |
| `agentVisualizer.autoOpen` | `false` | Auto-open when an agent session starts |

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ (LTS recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- Claude Code CLI
- For the VS Code extension: a VSCode-compatible IDE 1.85+ (e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/))

## Development

```bash
pnpm i              # install dependencies for all packages
pnpm run setup      # configure Claude Code hooks (one-time)
pnpm run dev        # start dev server + event relay
```

`pnpm run dev` starts both the Next.js dev server and an event relay that receives Claude Code events and streams them to the browser via SSE.

Other scripts:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pnpm run dev:demo` | Start with demo/mock data |
| `pnpm run dev:relay` | Run the event relay server standalone |
| `pnpm run dev:extension` | Watch-build the extension |
| `pnpm run build:all` | Production build (webview + extension) |
| `pnpm run build:web` | Build the Next.js web app |
| `pnpm run build:extension` | Build the extension |
| `pnpm run build:webview` | Build the webview assets |

## Privacy & Telemetry

Agent Flow ships **opt-out** anonymous usage telemetry, enabled by default only
in the published `npx agent-flow-app` binary. `pnpm run dev` and the VS Code
extension emit nothing. Only aggregate events are sent — session count,
duration, event count, OS/arch, Agent Flow version, distinct model IDs
observed, which runtimes were watched, and error class names. Prompts, file
paths, tool calls, user info, and environment variables are never sent.

- **Turn off:** `export AGENT_FLOW_TELEMETRY=false` or `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`
  (disabled installs write zero state to disk — no `~/.agent-flow/` directory)
- **Inspect the payload:** `cat ~/.agent-flow/telemetry/events.jsonl`
- **Full schema + exact fields:** see the v0.8.1 entry in
  [extension/CHANGELOG.md](extension/CHANGELOG.md) or the `serialize()` function
  in [scripts/telemetry.ts](scripts/telemetry.ts)
- **Reset your anonymous identity:** delete `~/.agent-flow/installation-id` —
  a fresh random UUIDv4 will be generated on next run
