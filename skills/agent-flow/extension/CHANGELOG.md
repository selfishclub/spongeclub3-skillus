# Changelog

## 0.9.1

- Fix: Claude Code session discovery on Windows — workspace-to-project-dir matching is now case-insensitive on win32 (#57, part of #4)
  - VS Code reports drive letters lowercase (`c:\...`) while Claude Code encodes them uppercase (`C--...`), so the encoded-directory lookup, the subfolder-session prefix check, and the cwd containment check could all silently miss — no sessions appeared at all
  - The workspace project dir is now resolved to its actual on-disk casing at startup, and all path comparisons are case-folded on Windows (matching the Codex-side fix from 0.9.0)

## 0.9.0

- **New model support — Claude Fable 5 / Mythos 5, Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8, GPT-5.x Codex** (#57)
  - Context window sizing: `fable`/`mythos` family recognized as 1M context (previously fell back to 200k, showing the gauge 5× overfull); `gpt-*` family recognized as 400k as the fallback when Codex doesn't report its own authoritative window. Sonnet 5 / Opus 4.8 already matched the existing family patterns
  - Cost display: per-model-family blended $/M rates (Fable/Mythos $10/$50, Opus $5/$25, Sonnet $3/$15, Haiku $1/$5, GPT-5.x Codex $1.75/$14) replace the single Sonnet-class rate that was applied to every agent. Agents now carry the detected model ID, and the cost pill, summary panel, and per-tool breakdown all use the owning agent's rate
- **Codex session discovery fixes** — addresses reports of Codex sessions not appearing
  - Windows: workspace/cwd matching is now case-insensitive on win32 (VS Code reports `c:\...`, Codex writes `C:\...` — sessions never matched)
  - Large `session_meta`: the first-line reader now grows up to 1MB instead of a fixed 64KB — newer Codex versions embed full base instructions and AGENTS.md content, which silently broke cwd extraction and skipped the session
  - Silent cwd mismatch: when recent Codex sessions exist but none ran in the current workspace, a warning now says so (the most common cause: launching `npx agent-flow-app` from a different directory than the Codex session). Warnings are visible without `--verbose`
- Fix: assistant messages in Codex sessions were labeled "CLAUDE" in the transcript panels and canvas bubbles — the label now follows the session runtime ("CODEX") (#49)

## 0.8.1

- **Opt-out anonymous usage telemetry** — Agent Flow now tracks whether people come back after day 1 so we can tell whether it's actually useful. Only aggregate session metadata is sent, never prompts, file paths, or code
  - What's sent: session count, duration, event count, OS/arch, Agent Flow version, distinct Claude/Codex model IDs observed during each session, which runtimes were watched (`claude`, `codex`, or `claude,codex`), and error class names on crashes
  - What's NEVER sent: prompts, tool calls, tool responses, file paths, repo names, user name/email/hostname, environment variables, error messages or stack traces
  - Turn off: `export AGENT_FLOW_TELEMETRY=false` or `export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`. Disabled installs write nothing to disk — no `~/.agent-flow/` state file, no telemetry dir
  - Only the published `npx agent-flow-app` binary emits. `pnpm run dev` stays silent so contributor iterations don't land in the data
  - Inspect the exact payload locally: `cat ~/.agent-flow/telemetry/events.jsonl`
- Remove `@vercel/analytics` — conflicts with the first-party-only commitment in the privacy doc

## 0.8.0

- **Codex runtime support** — available in all three entry points: VS Code extension, `pnpm run dev`, and `npx agent-flow-app`. Agent Flow now watches Codex rollouts at `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` alongside Claude Code sessions
  - New `agentVisualizer.runtime` setting (VS Code only): `"auto"` (default, watches both), `"claude"`, or `"codex"`
  - `AGENT_FLOW_RUNTIME` environment variable (`claude` / `codex` / `auto`) gives the same opt-out in `pnpm run dev` and `npx agent-flow-app`
  - Respects `CODEX_HOME` for non-default installs
  - Parses all five Codex rollout record types (`session_meta`, `turn_context`, `response_item`, `event_msg`, `compacted`) — surfaces tool calls (`exec_command`, `apply_patch`, `write_stdin`, `update_plan`), reasoning, web searches
  - Uses Codex's own authoritative token counts (`event_msg.token_count.info.last_token_usage.input_tokens` and `model_context_window`) instead of estimating
  - Handles auto-compaction via the `compacted` event — context gauge resets cleanly instead of staying frozen
  - Filters Codex's IDE-context wrapper (`# Context from my IDE setup:` + `## My request for Codex:`) and pure injections (AGENTS.md, environment_context, turn_aborted) from user messages
- Refactor: new `AgentSessionWatcher` interface and shared watcher→panel wiring (`session-runtime.ts`) replaces per-runtime duplication. The Codex watcher is vscode-free so it works in the relay/CLI without modification
- Parser unit test suite with real-shape rollout fixture — run via `pnpm test`

## 0.7.0

- **Opus 4.7 support** (#43)
  - Context window sizing now uses family-based pattern matching, so new Opus/Sonnet releases (4.7, future 4.x / 5.x) pick up their 1M context without a code change
  - Redacted thinking blocks (Opus 4.7 returns thinking as an encrypted signature by default) now show a "Thinking..." placeholder bubble instead of being silently dropped
- Fix: Windows hook deduplication — `isAgentFlowHook` now normalizes path separators before matching, so old entries are correctly replaced on re-registration (prevents settings.json from accumulating duplicates) (#42)
- Fix: respect `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT` env var and setting — context gauge caps to 200k when set (#39)
- Fix: relay path encoding for non-ASCII workspace paths (CJK, Cyrillic, accented Latin) (#38)
- Fix: duplicate subagent nodes from hook server and transcript parser race (#34)
- Fix: duplicate React key warning on session switch (#33)
- Fix: web app SSE connection failure in standalone dev mode (#32)

## 0.6.2

- Fix: session detection for workspace paths containing underscores or other special characters (#18, #19)

## 0.6.1

- npx support — `npx agent-flow-app` starts the visualizer without cloning the repo
- Internal refactor: shared relay module and build config

## 0.6.0

- Standalone web app — run Agent Flow in the browser without VS Code (`pnpm run dev`)
- pnpm workspace monorepo setup
- VS Code debug and dev configuration
- Fix: event loss from React strict mode double-invocation
- Fix: SSE relay security hardening (localhost-only binding, restricted CORS, bounded event buffer)

## 0.5.0

- Fix: heavy performance degradation during long sessions with many agents (#20)
  - Decouple canvas rendering from React state — canvas reads from a ref at 60fps, React re-renders only on data changes
  - Virtualize transcript and message feed panels for constant render cost regardless of message count
  - Replace timeline panel DOM with canvas rendering
  - Fix tool call cleanup leak that caused unbounded object growth after ~5000 events
  - Fix event log cap causing mass event replay in mock/stress mode
  - Cap simulation loop at 60fps to reduce CPU/GPU usage
- Add stress test scenarios for profiling (`?stress=light|medium|heavy|extreme`)
- Add performance overlay for debugging (`?perf`)
- Fix passive event listener warning when panning canvas
- File attention panel: show agent count instead of full name list

## 0.4.7

- Fix: reset button in review mode no longer breaks the extension
  - Active agents are preserved across reset; only completed state and visual history are cleared
  - Event log is trimmed to retain agent_spawn events so review mode seeking works correctly

## 0.4.6

- Updated README: clarified automatic hook configuration behavior
- Updated description and tagline

## 0.4.5

- Initial public release
- Real-time visualization of Claude Code agent execution flows
- Auto-detection of Claude Code sessions via transcript watching
- Claude Code hooks integration for live event streaming
- Multi-session support with session tabs
- Interactive canvas with agent nodes, tool calls, and particles
- Timeline, file attention, and transcript panels
- JSONL event log file watching
