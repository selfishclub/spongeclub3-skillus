## Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code** installed and authenticated. [Install guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
2. A terminal (macOS, Linux, or WSL on Windows)
3. Node.js 18+ (for the installer CLI)

## Installation

### Install all skills (recommended for first-time users)

```bash
npx openclaudia install --all
```

This copies all 62+ skill files to `~/.claude/skills/`, making them available as slash commands in every Claude Code session.

### Install specific skills

```bash
# Just the ones you need
npx openclaudia install seo-audit write-blog reddit-marketing

# List available skills
npx openclaudia list
```

### Manual installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/OpenClaudia/openclaudia-skills.git

# Copy skills to your global skills directory
cp -r openclaudia-skills/skills/seo-audit ~/.claude/skills/

# Or to a specific project
cp -r openclaudia-skills/skills/seo-audit ./your-project/.claude/skills/
```

### Verify installation

Open Claude Code and type `/` — you should see the installed skills listed as available slash commands.

---

## Your First Skill

Let's run an SEO audit to see how skills work:

```
$ claude

> /seo-audit https://yoursite.com
```

Claude will:
1. Crawl your site's key pages
2. Check meta tags, headings, schema markup, and page speed
3. Analyze keyword optimization and internal linking
4. Generate a detailed report with actionable fixes
5. Save the report as a file in your project

That's it. Every skill follows this pattern: **invoke with a slash command, provide input, get output.**

## Setting Up API Keys

Skills work without API keys (using web search and free data), but they're more powerful with live API access.

Create a file at `~/.claude/.env.global` or add to your project's `.env`:

```bash
# Most impactful keys to set up first:
RESEND_API_KEY=your_key        # Enables actual email sending
SEMRUSH_API_KEY=your_key       # Rich SEO & keyword data
UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID=your_key    # Featured images for blog posts
```

See the full list of API keys in the [README](README.md#api-configuration).

**Priority order for API setup:**
1. **Resend** — if you want to send emails directly
2. **SemRush or Ahrefs** — for real keyword and backlink data
3. **Google OAuth** — for Analytics, Search Console, and Ads reporting
4. **Unsplash** — for stock images in blog posts
5. **Everything else** — add as needed for specific skills

---

## Combining Skills

The real power of OpenClaudia is chaining skills together. You can ask Claude to run multiple skills in one conversation:

### Example: Full content pipeline

```
> Research keywords for "AI form builder", write a blog post targeting the best
> keyword, then create a LinkedIn post and Reddit comment promoting it.
```

Claude will automatically use `keyword-research` → `write-blog` → `linkedin-content` → `reddit-marketing` in sequence.

### Example: Competitor teardown

```
> Do a full competitor analysis of competitor.com — SEO audit, content gap
> analysis, and backlink comparison. Then create a content strategy to beat them.
```

Claude chains: `competitor-analysis` → `seo-audit` → `content-gap-analysis` → `backlink-audit` → `content-strategy`

### Example: Launch campaign

```
> We're launching a new feature next week. Create a launch strategy, write the
> announcement blog post, email sequence, social media posts, and Discord
> announcement.
```

Claude uses: `launch-strategy` → `write-blog` → `email-sequence` → `social-content` → `discord-bot`

---

## Project-Level vs Global Skills

### Global skills (`~/.claude/skills/`)

Available in every Claude Code session, across all projects. This is where `npx openclaudia install` puts skills by default.

Best for: general marketing skills you use everywhere.

### Project-level skills (`.claude/skills/`)

Available only in that project's Claude Code sessions. Use this when you want to customize a skill for a specific project.

```bash
# Copy and customize a skill for your project
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/write-blog .claude/skills/write-blog

# Edit the SKILL.md to add project-specific instructions
# e.g., "Always mention our product name as 'FormAI'"
```

Project-level skills override global skills with the same name.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Be specific with your prompts

```
# Vague — skill has to guess
> /write-blog "AI tools"

# Specific — better output
> /write-blog "10 AI Form Builders Compared: Features, Pricing, and Which One
> to Choose in 2026" --target-keyword "best AI form builder" --word-count 2500
```

### 2. Provide context in your project

If your project has a `CLAUDE.md` file with brand guidelines, tone of voice, or product details, skills will automatically use that context.

### 3. Review and iterate

Skills generate a first draft. Ask Claude to refine:

```
> /write-blog "Topic here"
> Make the introduction more compelling and add a comparison table
> Add internal links to our /pricing and /features pages
```

### 4. Use natural language, not just slash commands

You don't have to use slash commands. Claude recognizes when a skill is relevant:

```
> Write a blog post about AI form builders
# Claude automatically uses the write-blog skill

> Audit the SEO on my site
# Claude automatically uses seo-audit
```

### 5. Chain skills for comprehensive campaigns

Instead of running skills one at a time, describe your goal and let Claude orchestrate:

```
> I need a complete content marketing campaign for our product launch next month.
> Start with competitor analysis, then create a content calendar, write the key
> pieces, and set up the email drip campaign.
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Skills don't appear as slash commands

```bash
# Reinstall
npx openclaudia install --all

# Check they're in the right place
ls ~/.claude/skills/
```

### API calls fail

```
# Check your env file
cat ~/.claude/.env.global

# Make sure the key is set (not empty)
echo $RESEND_API_KEY
```

### Skill output isn't what you expected

- Add more context to your prompt
- Check if the skill needs an API key for richer data
- Open an [issue](https://github.com/OpenClaudia/openclaudia-skills/issues) if the skill's instructions need improvement

### Skills conflict with project-level instructions

Project-level `.claude/skills/` takes priority over global `~/.claude/skills/`. If a skill behaves differently in one project, check for a project-level override.
