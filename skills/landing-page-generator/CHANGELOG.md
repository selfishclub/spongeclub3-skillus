# Changelog

All notable changes to the Claude Skills Library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.11.0] - 2026-06-29 (AI-skills modernization — 2026 agentic capabilities)

Closes the biggest coverage gap surfaced by an audit of the library's AI/LLM skills: the newest agentic capabilities (reasoning effort, the memory tool, context editing, batch processing, computer use, LLM-as-judge) had near-zero coverage. **343 skills · 17 domains · 786 Python tools** (engineering 82 → 86).

### Added

Four new engineering skills, each with stdlib-only Python tools and reference knowledge bases:

- **`extended-thinking-architect`** — decide reasoning effort / thinking budgets: when reasoning pays off vs. a cheaper model + better prompt, per-phase budget allocation across an agent loop, cost/quality/latency tradeoffs, overthinking guards. Tools: `reasoning_budget_advisor.py`, `reasoning_loop_allocator.py`.
- **`batch-api-orchestrator`** — batch vs. realtime/streaming decisions, bulk job design (chunking, idempotency, partial-failure reconciliation), the ~half-cost-for-latency tradeoff. Tools: `batch_cost_estimator.py`, `batch_job_planner.py`.
- **`computer-use-automation`** — the screenshot→reason→action loop, computer-use vs. structured-tool/MCP decision matrix, reliability & safety patterns. Tools: `tool_choice_advisor.py`, `action_safety_linter.py`.
- **`agentic-evaluation-framework`** — LLM-as-judge rubric design, bias mitigation, pairwise ranking (Elo + Bradley-Terry). Tools: `rubric_scorer.py`, `pairwise_ranking.py`.

### Changed

Four existing AI skills upgraded with modern coverage (each adds references + a tool and bumps its version):

- **`llm-cost-optimizer`** — prompt-caching economics, batch tradeoff, reasoning-effort cost, structured-output overhead (+ `cache_savings_calculator.py`).
- **`context-engine`** — the memory-tool pattern, context editing/compaction, explicit 1M-context strategies (+ `context_budget_planner.py`).
- **`agent-workflow-designer`** — subagent scoping/creation (tool allow-lists, isolated context, return contracts) and multi-model cost estimation (+ `multi_agent_cost_estimator.py`).
- **`mcp-server-builder`** — streaming/progress for long tools, computer-use-via-MCP, batch-friendly tool design (+ `tool_schema_linter.py`).

All content is model-agnostic and principle-focused (no hardcoded vendor prices or invented API signatures); all tools are standard-library-only with `--json` output. Manifests, website, and prose surfaces regenerated to 343/17/786.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-06-29 (Cross-platform surface refresh + single-source manifests)

Realigns every assistant-facing surface with the real library (**339 skills · 17 domains · 774 Python tools**) and unifies the machine catalogs behind one generator so they can no longer drift independently.

### Added

- **Cursor Project Rules** — `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (modern replacement for `.cursorrules`): `repo-overview.mdc` (always-on), `skill-authoring.mdc` (auto-attaches on `**/SKILL.md`), `python-tools.mdc` (auto-attaches on `**/scripts/*.py`).
- **Per-domain Claude Code plugins** — `plugin.json` for the 9 domains that lacked one (legal, data-analytics, hr-operations, sales-success, personal-productivity, documents, vertical-advisors, research, workflow); all 17 domains now install as plugins.
- **`build_manifest.py` now emits every machine catalog from one source** — in addition to `cli/skills.json` and `registry.json`, it regenerates `.gemini/skills-index.json` (was stale at 203) and the website catalog `skills.json` (was stale at 294). Per-skill entries gained `license`, `category`, `subdomain`, and `tools_count`.

### Changed

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → v3.0.0** — corrected per-plugin counts and expanded from 8 to all 17 domain plugins.
- **Prose configs refreshed** — `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`, `.goosehints`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, and `docs/` updated to 339/17/774; removed references to dead directories (`engineering-team/`, `marketing-skill/`).
- **Website regenerated** — all 339 skill pages, 17 domain pages, `llms.txt`, agents/commands catalogs, and sitemap rebuilt from the refreshed catalog.

### Fixed

- Eliminated count drift across platform surfaces (skills had been reported as 204, 294, 312, and 338 in different files; domains as 13, 15, and 16; tools as 559, 681, 730, and 784).

## [4.9.0] - 2026-06-15 (Token efficiency — progressive disclosure)

Behavior-preserving refactor that cuts the per-invocation token cost of the heaviest skills by moving deep content into load-on-demand `references/` files, following the Anthropic Agent Skills three-tier loading model (description always resident → SKILL.md body on trigger → references on demand).

### Changed

**73 token-heavy skills refactored to progressive disclosure.** Oversized `SKILL.md` bodies were slimmed to lean "maps" (overview, core capabilities, when-to-use, and a `## References` section with "read this when…" pointers), with the deep content (frameworks, procedures, tables, code, checklists) moved **verbatim** into `references/` files. No knowledge was dropped — distinctive-content retention was spot-checked across the affected skills.

- **Top 20 cross-domain offenders** (engineering, marketing, ra-qm-team, business-growth, project-management): bodies cut from 5.6K–18.6K to 1.0K–1.8K tokens each; combined per-trigger cost ~155K → ~28K tokens. 70 new reference files.
- **All 53 token-heavy Project Management skills**: PM-domain Tier-2 body cost 226,646 → 91,516 tokens (−60%); every one of the 66 PM skills now uses progressive disclosure (heavy bodies 53 → 0). 69 reference files added/extended.
- Affected skill `metadata.version` bumped and `metadata.updated` set to 2026-06-15; a few oversized always-resident `description` fields tightened to trigger-rich single sentences.

### Added

- **`scripts/skill_token_audit.py`** — stdlib-only tool that scores every skill on the three loading tiers (description / body / references token cost), flags missing progressive disclosure, orphan references, and oversized bodies/descriptions, and emits a refactor-priority worklist (`table`, `summary`, or `json`).

### Fixed

- **Broken reference links** in several PM skills (`program-manager`, `delivery-manager`, `agile-coach`) that pointed at `references/*.md` files which never existed — content is now created and correctly linked.
- **Orphan references** across 11 skills (9 PM + 2 cross-domain) whose `references/` files existed but were never linked from the body — now linked with "read this when…" notes.

### Notes

- `cli/skills.json` and `registry.json` regenerated.
- Token counts are chars/4 estimates used for ranking, not billing.

## [4.7.0] - 2026-05-22 (Tier 3 of PM depth)

### Added

**Output evaluation harness for artifact-generating PM skills (`evals/`).** Deterministic scoring (no LLM) for any markdown artifact, scored 0-100 against the skill's red-flags + success criteria.

Framework:
- `evals/engine.py` — generic check evaluator. 13 supported check types: regex, regex_not, section_present, section_word_count, section_sentence_count, keyword_any, keyword_all, keyword_none, has_table, has_list, url_count, length_in_range, line_count_range.
- `evals/run.py` — runner. Supports `--all`, `--skill <name>`, `--artifact <path>`, `--format markdown|json`, `--threshold <int>`, `--output <file>`.
- `evals/README.md` — framework documentation.

12 rubrics (190+ criteria total, each anchored to a specific red-flag or success-criterion item):
- create-prd · prfaq · ai-feature-prd · brainstorm-okrs · status-update-generator
- post-mortem · north-star-metric · product-vision · pricing-prd
- roadmap-communication · release-notes · customer-feedback-triage

Smoke-test (all 12 worked examples scored against their own rubric):

| Skill | Score |
|---|---|
| ai-feature-prd | 100 |
| customer-feedback-triage | 100 |
| north-star-metric | 100 |
| post-mortem | 100 |
| product-vision | 100 |
| status-update-generator | 100 |
| brainstorm-okrs | 95 |
| pricing-prd | 95 |
| prfaq | 94 |
| roadmap-communication | 94 |
| release-notes | 90 |
| create-prd | 89 |

12/12 pass at threshold 70. High scores reflect that the worked examples were authored as exemplars; the rubrics are calibrated to catch realistic failures (drafts with missing sections, blame language, output-as-KR, watermelon status, etc.).

### Changed

- PM README updated with new "Output evaluation harness" section.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-05-22 (Tier 2 of PM depth)

### Added

**Red-flag / anti-pattern library in every PM skill (54 files, ~12,000 lines).** Each skill now has `references/red-flags.md` with 10-12 concrete anti-patterns, paired bad/good QUOTED artifact snippets, and a "How to catch it" check question. Anchors to canonical authors (Wodtke, Wake, Lawrence, Vacanti, Allspaw, Dekker, Cagan, Klein, Klement, Ellis, McClure, Karpathy, Anthropic RSP, Ramanujam, Westendorp, etc.). Differentiates from generic AI-generated framework summaries.

Highlight red flags:
- status-update-generator: watermelon status (green outside, red inside)
- create-prd: solution-before-problem (Section 7 bloat)
- post-mortem: blame language vs systemic framing
- brainstorm-okrs: output-as-KR, sandbagging, drift mid-quarter
- customer-feedback-triage: squeaky-wheel bias, sales-driven roadmap
- north-star-metric: NSM = revenue (it's not)
- ai-feature-prd: hallucination tolerance hand-waving, no fallback model
- linear-expert: cycle-as-sprint anti-patterns, GraphQL N+1

**Runnable skill-chain pipelines (`pipelines/`).** Five stdlib-only scripts that chain multiple PM skills end-to-end with one command. Each supports `--demo`, `--input <json>`, `--format markdown|json`, `--output <dir>`:
- `feature-end-to-end.py` — discovery → PRD → OKRs → backlog → release (chains 7 skills)
- `weekly-cadence.py` — Jira/Linear adapter → status + flow + dependency (4 skills)
- `customer-discovery.py` — interview-synthesis → assumptions → experiments → NSM (4 skills)
- `post-mortem-flow.py` — post-mortem → pre-mortem follow-ups → dependency-map (3 skills)
- `launch-coordination.py` — beta-program → feature-flag-strategy → launch-playbook → release-notes (4 skills)
- `pipelines/README.md` — when-to-use, inputs/outputs, integration points

Pipelines gracefully degrade — if a downstream skill's tool isn't available, the pipeline stubs that stage and continues, so the chain always completes.

### Changed

- PM README updated with new "Red flags" and "Runnable pipelines" sections.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-05-22 (later)

### Added (Tier 1 of PM depth investment)

**Worked examples in every PM skill (54 files, ~13,000 lines).** Until now, PM skills had frameworks (references/) and blank templates (assets/) but no finished artifact. PMs copy-paste-and-modify; that fails when there's nothing to copy. Now every skill has `examples/<scenario>.md` with a realistic company, the workflow applied, and the full generated artifact. Recurring fictional cast (Acme Analytics, Wayfinder, Northwind, Helix Platform, Pylon) means scenarios cross-reference each other naturally.

Highlight examples:
- `execution/create-prd/examples/shared-dashboards-prd.md` — full 8-section PRD
- `execution/ai-feature-prd/examples/ai-meeting-notes-summarizer.md` — AI PRD with eval spec, guardrails, model fallback
- `execution/post-mortem/examples/payment-processing-outage.md` — blameless RCA for a 47-min outage
- `execution/status-update-generator/examples/acme-search-platform-weekly.md` — Yellow-status weekly exec update
- `execution/activation-funnel/examples/freemium-saas-day-7-retention-diagnosis.md` — AARRR funnel diagnosis
- `discovery/interview-synthesis/examples/wayfinder-8-interview-synthesis.md` — 8 interviews → opportunity tree
- `career/pm-interview-prep/examples/stripe-circles-new-market-product.md` — full CIRCLES answer

**Live data adapters (`tools/adapters/`).** Three stdlib-only scripts that pull from Jira / Linear / Notion APIs and emit JSON in the shapes PM Python tools expect:
- `jira_to_json.py` — Jira REST v3 with JQL; output formats: raw / status-update / cycle-time / dependency-map
- `linear_to_json.py` — Linear GraphQL; output formats: same set
- `notion_to_json.py` — Notion REST query; output formats: raw / prds / okrs / roadmap / feedback

Pipe directly: `jira_to_json.py --format cycle-time | flow_metrics.py --input -`. Auth via env vars (`JIRA_TOKEN`, `LINEAR_API_KEY`, `NOTION_TOKEN`).

**15 PM skills wrapped as MCP tools** in `scripts/mcp_server.py`:
`pm_create_prd`, `pm_status_update`, `pm_funnel_analyze`, `pm_flow_metrics`, `pm_dependency_map`, `pm_feedback_triage`, `pm_nsm_tree`, `pm_refinement_score`, `pm_interview_synthesize`, `pm_prioritize`, `pm_okr_validate`, `pm_roadmap_transform`, `pm_pre_mortem`, `pm_release_notes`, `pm_stakeholder_map`. Each accepts `format` (markdown / json / mermaid / confluence / notion / linear) and `input` (JSON object, JSON string, or file path). Smoke-tested end-to-end through the MCP JSON-RPC interface.

### Changed

- PM README updated with new "Live data adapters" and "MCP tools" sections, plus a Worked-examples highlight table.

- **4 new bundles** in `bundles.json`: `pm-starter-pack` (10 skills), `pm-scrum-master` (8), `pm-discovery-coach` (8), `pm-career-track` (6)

### Changed

- **Project Management bolded as the most-visited domain** in main `README.md`, `docs/SKILLS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`

- **PM `CLAUDE.md` rewritten** to cover all 42 skills, shared output schema, Linear/Notion integration patterns, and 6 workflow patterns

### Fixed

- **`scripts/build_manifest.py`** now recurses one level into container folders (e.g., `discovery/`, `execution/`, `career/`) so nested skills appear in the registry. Previously the registry undercounted PM by ~30 nested skills.
- Skill count reconciled across `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/SKILLS.md`, and `project-management/CLAUDE.md` (was inconsistent across 13 / 22 / 25). Authoritative count: **282 total, 42 PM**.
