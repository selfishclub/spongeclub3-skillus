## What you get

**Ship a SOC 2 audit. Run a sprint retro. Draft a board update. Spin up a fintech compliance program.** Real workflows you can finish today, not prompt templates that need a prompt engineer to drive them.

- **The only OSS skills library covering regulated industries.** SOC 2, ISO 13485, MDR, FDA, EU AI Act, NIS2, DORA, HIPAA, GDPR. 18 compliance frameworks with checklists, gap analyses, and audit-ready outputs.
- **Scripts that actually run, not just prompt templates.** 859 Python tools you can pipe into CI, MCP servers, or your own scripts. Standard library only, no pip cliffs.
- **Call one persona, get a stack of skills behind it.** `startup-cto`, `growth-marketer`, `solo-founder`, `cs-cto-advisor`, `cs-fintech-advisor`, and more. 76 expert identities ready out of the box.
- **Works with your AI assistant.** Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Aider, Goose, OpenCode, and ChatGPT / Claude.ai.
- **Discovery → delivery → career for product teams.** Project Management is the deepest domain — 68 skills, and every one ships with a worked example, an anti-pattern library, and a deterministic scoring rubric. 15 PM skills callable as MCP tools. 5 chain pipelines, 3 live data adapters. Jira / Linear / Notion / Productboard / Confluence. Tier 3 adds strategy frameworks (BMC, Lean Canvas, SWOT, Porter's, Ansoff) and GTM (gtm-strategy, ICP).
- **Runs the business, not just the codebase.** Business operations (capacity planning, process mapping, vendor and procurement management), applied research ops (market, product, clinical study design, research finance), and a stdlib-only markdown→HTML publishing pipeline with a CI-ready review gate.

*Supporting evidence:* 368 skills · 859 Python tools · 76 agents · 18 compliance frameworks · 20 domains · 11 platforms.

## How it works

### Pre-built expert identities

8 cross-domain personas that combine skills from multiple domains into a single expert:

`startup-cto` · `growth-marketer` · `solo-founder` · `content-strategist` · `devops-engineer` · `finance-lead` · `product-manager` · `skill-creator`

Activate with `/persona startup-cto` or just mention it in conversation. Add the 68 single-domain `cs-*` agents (e.g. `cs-cto-advisor`, `cs-fintech-advisor`, `cs-scrum-master`) for narrower expertise.

### Deep-dive skill packs

Three multi-skill packs go deeper on a single topic: **Playwright Pro** (browser automation, 8 sub-skills), **Self-Improving Agent** (agents that evaluate their own outputs, 6 sub-skills), and **AgentHub** (multi-agent orchestration, 7 sub-skills). See [standards/](standards/).

### Slash commands

26 commands for common workflows: `/tdd`, `/rice`, `/prd`, `/retro`, `/tech-debt`, `/security-scan`, `/sprint-plan`, `/changelog` and more. Run `/README` in Claude Code for the full list, or see [docs/commands/](docs/commands/).

### Ready-made kits by role

Pre-configured skill bundles for common roles:

`SaaS Founder Kit` · `DevOps Kit` · `Compliance Kit` · `Growth Kit` · `Product Kit` · `Data Kit` · `Security Kit` · `Finance Kit` · `PM Starter Pack` · `PM Career Track`

Install one bundle and the right set of skills lands in your project. See [bundles.json](bundles.json).

### Orchestration patterns

4 multi-agent patterns for complex workflows: sequential pipeline, parallel fan-out, supervisor delegation, and consensus voting. Defined in the [Orchestration Protocol standard](standards/).
