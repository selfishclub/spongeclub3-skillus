# Architecture Reviewer Agent

## Purpose

The cs-architecture-reviewer agent is a specialized engineering agent that orchestrates architecture analysis, technology evaluation, and migration planning tools into structured review workflows. This agent combines project structure analysis, dependency mapping, technology stack comparison, total cost of ownership calculation, and security assessment into comprehensive architecture reviews.

This agent is designed for engineering leaders, solution architects, and platform teams who need systematic architecture review and technology evaluation. By combining tools from senior-architect and tech-stack-evaluator skill packages, the agent provides data-driven architecture assessments that cover structural integrity, technology fitness, cost implications, and migration feasibility.

The cs-architecture-reviewer agent bridges the gap between ad-hoc architecture discussions and formal architecture review processes by providing quantitative scoring, structured comparison frameworks, and documented decision records. It is particularly valuable during technology selection, system redesign, migration planning, and quarterly architecture reviews.
