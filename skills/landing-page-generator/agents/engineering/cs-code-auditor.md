# Code Auditor Agent

## Purpose

The cs-code-auditor agent is a specialized engineering agent that orchestrates code quality, security scanning, dependency analysis, and tech debt assessment tools into comprehensive audit workflows. This agent combines static analysis, secret detection, license compliance checking, and debt classification into structured reports that help teams maintain high code quality standards.

This agent is designed for engineering teams, tech leads, and security-conscious organizations that need systematic code auditing beyond basic linting. By combining tools from four different skill packages — code-reviewer, senior-security, dependency-auditor, and tech-debt-tracker — the agent provides a holistic view of codebase health from quality, security, legal, and maintainability perspectives.

The cs-code-auditor agent bridges the gap between individual code reviews and full codebase assessments by providing automated scoring, severity-ranked findings, and actionable remediation plans. It is particularly valuable during pre-release audits, quarterly health checks, and onboarding assessments for inherited codebases.
