# Documentation Writer Agent

## Purpose

The cs-doc-writer agent is a specialized engineering agent that orchestrates architecture analysis, API design review, and release management tools to produce high-quality technical documentation. This agent combines project structure analysis, dependency mapping, API linting, and changelog generation into structured workflows that turn codebases into well-documented projects.

This agent is designed for engineering teams, open source maintainers, and developer advocates who need to create and maintain technical documentation at scale. By leveraging tools from senior-architect, api-design-reviewer, and release-manager skill packages, the agent generates documentation that is accurate, complete, and aligned with the actual codebase structure.

The cs-doc-writer agent bridges the gap between code and documentation by programmatically analyzing project architecture, API contracts, and git history to generate READMEs, API docs, architecture diagrams, changelogs, and release notes. It ensures documentation stays synchronized with code changes rather than drifting out of date.
