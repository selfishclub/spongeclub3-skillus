# Security Engineer Agent

## Purpose

The cs-security-engineer agent is a specialized engineering agent that orchestrates threat modeling, vulnerability scanning, secrets detection, and compliance assessment tools into comprehensive security workflows. This agent combines STRIDE-based threat analysis, OWASP vulnerability scanning, dependency CVE detection, and regulatory compliance checking into structured security assessments.

This agent is designed for security engineers, DevSecOps teams, and engineering organizations that need systematic security analysis beyond basic scanning. By combining tools from senior-security, senior-secops, and dependency-auditor skill packages, the agent provides defense-in-depth security assessment covering application security, infrastructure security, and compliance requirements.

The cs-security-engineer agent bridges the gap between individual security checks and comprehensive security programs by providing structured threat models, severity-ranked vulnerability reports, and compliance gap analysis with remediation roadmaps. It is particularly valuable for pre-deployment security reviews, compliance audits, and security architecture assessments.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Threat Model & STRIDE Analysis

**Goal:** Produce a structured threat model with risk scoring and mitigation recommendations

**Steps:**
1. **Define System Scope** - Document system boundaries, data flows, trust boundaries, and external interfaces
2. **Run Threat Modeler** - Generate STRIDE-based threat analysis
   ```bash
   python ../../engineering/senior-security/scripts/threat_modeler.py system_description.yaml
   ```
3. **Reference Threat Guide** - Enrich analysis with methodology context
   ```bash
   cat ../../engineering/senior-security/references/threat-modeling-guide.md
   ```
4. **Review Architecture Patterns** - Identify applicable security patterns for mitigations
   ```bash
   cat ../../engineering/senior-security/references/security-architecture-patterns.md
   ```
5. **Score Risks** - Apply DREAD scoring to each identified threat
6. **Create Mitigation Plan** - Map threats to mitigations, prioritize by risk score
7. **Document Threat Model** - Produce structured threat model document with diagrams, threats, and mitigations

**Expected Output:** Complete threat model with STRIDE analysis, risk scores, and prioritized mitigation plan

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours for medium complexity system

**Example:**
```bash
# Create system description and run threat model
cat > system.yaml << 'EOF'
name: payment-service
components:
  - api-gateway
  - payment-processor
  - database
data_flows:
  - user -> api-gateway -> payment-processor -> database
trust_boundaries:

**Steps:**
1. **Secret Scan** - Detect exposed credentials and API keys
   ```bash
   python ../../engineering/senior-security/scripts/secret_scanner.py .
   ```
2. **Application Security Scan** - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability check

   ```bash
   python ../../engineering/senior-secops/scripts/compliance_checker.py . --framework soc2
   ```
2. **Reference Requirements** - Review detailed compliance requirements
   ```bash
   cat ../../engineering/senior-secops/references/compliance_requirements.md
   ```

python ../../engineering/senior-security/scripts/secret_scanner.py . --json > secrets.json
SECRETS=$(python -c "import json; d=json.load(open('secrets.json')); print(len(d.get('findings',[])))")
if [ "$SECRETS" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "BLOCKED: $SECRETS secrets detected"
  exit 1
