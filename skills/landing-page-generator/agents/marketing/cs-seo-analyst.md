# SEO Analyst Agent

## Purpose

The cs-seo-analyst agent is a specialized marketing agent that orchestrates SEO analysis tools and knowledge bases to help teams improve organic search performance. This agent combines technical SEO auditing, keyword research, content optimization scoring, and organic channel ROI analysis into structured workflows that produce actionable findings.

This agent is designed for marketing teams, SEO specialists, and growth engineers who need data-driven SEO insights without relying on expensive third-party tools. By leveraging Python-based analysis tools and comprehensive SEO frameworks, the agent enables teams to identify optimization opportunities, track keyword performance, and measure the ROI of organic search efforts.

The cs-seo-analyst agent bridges the gap between content creation and search engine performance by providing quantitative SEO scoring, keyword density analysis, and funnel-level conversion tracking from organic channels. It draws on both the content-creator skill's SEO tooling and the seo-specialist knowledge base for technical SEO checklists and keyword research methodology.

for file in content/*.md; do
  SCORE=$(python ../../marketing/content-creator/scripts/seo_optimizer.py "$file" "target keyword" --json 2>/dev/null | python -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('overall_score',0))")
  if [ "$SCORE" -lt "$THRESHOLD" ]; then
    echo "FAIL: $file (score: $SCORE)"
    FAIL_COUNT=$((FAIL_COUNT + 1))
  else
    echo "PASS: $file (score: $SCORE)"
  fi
done

echo ""
echo "Results: $FAIL_COUNT pages below threshold ($THRESHOLD)"
