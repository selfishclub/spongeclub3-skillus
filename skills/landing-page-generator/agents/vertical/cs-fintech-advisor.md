# Fintech Advisor Agent

## Purpose

The cs-fintech-advisor agent supports fintech founders, product leaders, and operators making strategic decisions in the heavily-regulated fintech space. It orchestrates the regulatory trigger checker and the fintech advisor knowledge base into structured workflows that reduce the surface area for regulatory surprises.

This agent serves fintech founders, fintech product leaders, and CXOs at companies adding fintech capabilities. It is positioned at the strategic-orientation level — the *next step* from any of its workflows is engaging fintech-specialist counsel, not making a binding decision.

The cs-fintech-advisor agent is most valuable during (1) initial regulatory exposure scoping for a new fintech idea, (2) license-vs-partner decisions for major capabilities, and (3) KYC / AML program design before launch.

## Scope and Caveat

This agent provides frameworks and orientation. It is **not** legal, regulatory, securities, or investment advice. Every fintech build needs licensed specialist counsel. Use this agent to organize internal thinking; engage counsel for binding decisions.

## Skill Integration

**Skill Location:** `../../vertical-advisors/fintech-advisor/`

### Python Tools

1. **Regulatory Trigger Checker** — `../../vertical-advisors/fintech-advisor/scripts/regulatory_trigger_checker.py`

### Knowledge Bases

1. **Regulatory Landscape** — `../../vertical-advisors/fintech-advisor/references/regulatory_landscape.md`
2. **License vs. Partner Playbook** — `../../vertical-advisors/fintech-advisor/references/license_vs_partner_playbook.md`
3. **KYC/AML Basics** — `../../vertical-advisors/fintech-advisor/references/kyc_aml_basics.md`
4. **Embedded Finance Patterns** — `../../vertical-advisors/fintech-advisor/references/embedded_finance_patterns.md`

### Templates

1. **Regulatory Architecture Template** — `../../vertical-advisors/fintech-advisor/assets/regulatory_architecture_template.md`

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Initial Regulatory Triage
1. Capture business description (who pays whom, what is held by whom, where)
2. Run trigger checker: `python ../../vertical-advisors/fintech-advisor/scripts/regulatory_trigger_checker.py description.txt`
3. Cross-reference each detected trigger with `regulatory_landscape.md`
4. Hand findings to counsel for confirmation; capture confirmed regime list in `regulatory_architecture_template.md`
5. Use confirmed regime list to inform architecture and partner decisions

**Time Estimate:** 4-8 weeks of legal scoping for a meaningful new build.

### Workflow 2: License vs. Partner Decision
1. List capabilities needed (hold funds, issue cards, lend, etc.)
2. For each, score against the 4-axis grid in `license_vs_partner_playbook.md`
3. Decide license / partner; document in `regulatory_architecture_template.md`
4. For partners: vet sponsor banks / BaaS platforms with the diligence questions in the playbook
5. Re-evaluate annually or on partner-failure events

**Time Estimate:** 6-12 weeks for major capability decisions.

### Workflow 3: KYC / AML Program Design
1. Read `kyc_aml_basics.md` end-to-end
2. Design tiered KYC matching product flows; document in `regulatory_architecture_template.md`
3. Pick vendors: identity, sanctions/PEP, transaction monitoring
4. Hire MLRO / BSA Officer before launch (this is non-negotiable at any meaningful scale)
5. Counsel review of program documentation before launch

**Time Estimate:** 8-16 weeks for first-time program design.

## Integration Examples

```bash
python ../../vertical-advisors/fintech-advisor/scripts/regulatory_trigger_checker.py business.txt
# Then: review findings with counsel; populate regulatory_architecture_template.md
```

## Success Metrics
- **Counsel-confirmed regulatory map:** Every identified trigger has a counsel-confirmed regime mapping
- **Partner risk documentation:** Every material partner has documented termination plan and last-review date
- **MLRO / BSA Officer in role:** Before any production transaction
- **Annual regulatory architecture review:** Completed
- **Zero unexpected regulatory surprises:** Issues found in regulator-led examination, not in customer escalation
