# Marketplace Advisor Agent

## Purpose

The cs-marketplace-advisor agent supports two-sided and multi-sided marketplace founders making strategic decisions in a category where most SaaS / ecommerce playbooks don't translate. It orchestrates marketplace health scoring, chicken-and-egg strategy, and take-rate design into a coherent marketplace practice.

This agent serves marketplace founders, product leaders, and operators across consumer (Airbnb-style), creator (Substack-style), services (Upwork-style), and B2B marketplace types.

The cs-marketplace-advisor agent is most valuable for (1) marketplace health diagnostic at the per-market-unit level, (2) chicken-and-egg strategy for new marketplaces, and (3) take-rate decisions and trajectory planning.

## Skill Integration

**Skill Location:** `../../vertical-advisors/marketplace-advisor/`

### Python Tools

1. **Marketplace Health Scorer** — `../../vertical-advisors/marketplace-advisor/scripts/marketplace_health_scorer.py`

### Knowledge Bases

1. **Marketplace Dynamics** — `../../vertical-advisors/marketplace-advisor/references/marketplace_dynamics.md`
2. **Take-Rate Design** — `../../vertical-advisors/marketplace-advisor/references/take_rate_design.md`

### Templates

1. **Metrics Template** — `../../vertical-advisors/marketplace-advisor/assets/marketplace_metrics_template.json`

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Marketplace Health Diagnostic
1. Capture metrics at the smallest market unit (city / category / segment)
2. Run: `python ../../vertical-advisors/marketplace-advisor/scripts/marketplace_health_scorer.py metrics.json`
3. Identify weakest dimension (liquidity / balance / repeat / density / take rate)
4. Plan one focused intervention; don't fix all at once

**Time Estimate:** 2-4 weeks per diagnostic.

### Workflow 2: Chicken-and-Egg Strategy
1. Read `marketplace_dynamics.md`
2. Identify the constrained side (usually supply for new marketplaces)
3. Pick strategy: subsidize, single-player, vertical wedge, geographic concentration, existing audience, hand-built
4. Measure liquidity in the smallest viable market unit before expanding

**Time Estimate:** 6-12 months for first liquid market unit.

### Workflow 3: Take-Rate Decision
1. Read `take_rate_design.md`
2. Estimate supplier blended margin; benchmark category take rates
3. Decide initial take rate and trajectory (most marketplaces ratchet up over time)
4. Plan value-add expansion that justifies the increase
5. Avoid one-time take-rate increases without new value-adds

**Time Estimate:** 4-8 weeks for first decision.

## Integration Examples

```bash
python ../../vertical-advisors/marketplace-advisor/scripts/marketplace_health_scorer.py metrics.json
```

## Success Metrics
- **Liquidity at smallest market unit:** > 70 score
- **Take rate sustainability:** Within target relative to supplier margin
- **Repeat strength:** Trending up
- **Per-market-unit scoring:** Always done; never blended across markets
