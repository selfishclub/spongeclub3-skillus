# Project Management Skills

!!! success "★ The most-visited domain in Claude Skills"
    **66 production-ready PM skills** spanning discovery, execution, career growth, strategy frameworks, GTM, and tool integrations. PMs from APM to CPO use these daily to ship faster with fewer meetings.

The PM domain is a complete operating system for product and project work. Every artifact a PM produces (PRD, OKR, roadmap, status update, retro, decision log) has a skill that scaffolds it, with portable output to Jira, Linear, Notion, Productboard, or Confluence.

!!! tip "Production toolkit, not just docs"
    Every PM skill ships with:

    - **A worked example** — realistic scenario + full generated artifact you can copy
    - **A red-flag library** — 10-12 concrete anti-patterns with bad/good quoted examples
    - **A deterministic scoring rubric** (for 12 artifact-generating skills) — paste your draft, get 0-100 with specific failures
    - **MCP integration** (for 15 PM skills) — callable from any AI conversation
    - **Live data adapters** for Jira / Linear / Notion — `jira_to_json.py | status_generator.py`
    - **5 chain pipelines** — run multi-skill flows with one command
