# Personal Productivity Skills

Utility skills for individual workflows that don't fit cleanly into a single business domain — career, prospecting, meetings, naming, and bookkeeping.

## Design Notes

- All scripts use the Python standard library only — no `pip install` needed.
- Each script supports both human-readable and `--json` output.
- Each skill follows the standard package layout: `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`.
- These skills are deliberately scoped to **single-person workflows**. Team-level workflows belong in `business-growth/`, `sales-success/`, `hr-operations/`, or `finance/`.

## Cross-Domain Integration

|--------------|-----------|

| User-story authoring from customer-interview pains | `product-team/user-story/` |
| Cash-flow forecasting from monthly invoice summaries | `c-level-advisor/cs-cfo-advisor` |
| Brand-narrative work after picking a domain name | `marketing/brand-strategist/` |
