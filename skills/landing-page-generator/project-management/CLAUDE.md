**Key Features:**

- **Linear + Notion** integration patterns (GraphQL + REST)
- **15+ Python CLI tools** across role-based, discovery, execution, career
- **Shared output schema** (`--format json|markdown|mermaid|confluence|notion|linear`) — see `SHARED_OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md`
- **Worked examples** in `examples/` showing end-to-end flows
- **Role-based Quick Start** in `README.md` from APM → CPO

## Shared Output Format Schema

All PM Python tools follow `SHARED_OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md`:

```bash
python <tool>.py --format <json|markdown|mermaid|confluence|notion|linear> [--output file]
```

When generating outputs for a PM artifact, always consider which format the consumer expects:
- **json** for machine pipelines (CI, MCP servers, agents)
- **markdown** for GitHub PRs/READMEs (default)
- **mermaid** for visual diagrams (story maps, roadmaps, dependency graphs, opportunity trees)
- **confluence** for Confluence pages via Atlassian MCP
- **notion** for Notion pages via API
- **linear** for Linear issues via API

## Atlassian MCP Integration

**Purpose:** Direct integration with Jira and Confluence via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Capabilities:**
- Create, read, update Jira issues
- Manage Confluence pages and spaces
- Automate workflows and transitions
- Generate reports and dashboards
- Bulk operations on issues

**Setup:** Atlassian MCP server configured in Claude Code settings

**Usage Pattern:**
```bash
mcp__atlassian__create_issue project="PROJ" summary="New feature" type="Story"
mcp__atlassian__create_page space="TEAM" title="Sprint Retrospective"
```

## Linear Integration (linear-expert/)

Linear's API is GraphQL-first. Common patterns:

```graphql
# List issues
query { issues(first: 50, filter: { state: { type: { eq: "started" } } }) {
  nodes { id identifier title priority assignee { name } }
}}

# Create issue
mutation { issueCreate(input: {
  teamId: "...", title: "...", description: "...", priorityLabel: "High"
}) { issue { id identifier url } } }
```

See `linear-expert/references/linear-graphql-patterns.md` for full library.

## Notion Integration (notion-pm/)

Notion API is REST. PM workflows center on DB-driven artifacts:

```bash
# Create a PRD page in the PRDs database
curl -X POST https://api.notion.com/v1/pages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "parent": { "database_id": "<prd-db-id>" },
    "properties": { ... },
    "children": [ <blocks from prd_scaffolder.py --format notion> ]
  }'
```

See `notion-pm/references/notion-api-patterns.md` for full library.

**notion-pm/** - DB-driven PM artifacts (PRDs DB, OKRs DB, Roadmap DB, Decisions DB), Notion API REST patterns

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Discovery → Execution → Delivery

```
brainstorm-ideas → identify-assumptions → brainstorm-experiments → pre-mortem
      ↓                                                                    ↓
create-prd → brainstorm-okrs → outcome-roadmap → prioritization-frameworks
      ↓
backlog-refinement → story-splitting → (build) → release-notes
      ↓
status-update-generator → (weekly exec comms)
```

### Pattern 2: Sprint Planning (Data-Driven)

```bash
python scrum-master/scripts/sprint_capacity_calculator.py team.json
python scrum-master/scripts/velocity_analyzer.py sprints.json
python execution/prioritization-frameworks/scripts/prioritization_scorer.py backlog.json --framework rice
python execution/cycle-time-analyzer/scripts/flow_metrics.py issues.json
mcp__atlassian__create_sprint board="TEAM-board" name="Sprint 23"
```

### Pattern 3: Cross-Team Coordination

```bash
python execution/dependency-map/scripts/dependency_graph.py deps.json --format mermaid
python execution/daci-framework/...  # Document decision rights
python execution/status-update-generator/scripts/status_generator.py --format confluence
mcp__atlassian__create_page space="PROG" title="Weekly status" body="$(...)"
```

### Pattern 4: Customer Discovery → Roadmap

```bash
python discovery/interview-synthesis/scripts/interview_synthesizer.py interviews.json --format mermaid
python discovery/identify-assumptions/scripts/assumption_tracker.py opportunities.json
python execution/north-star-metric/scripts/metric_tree_builder.py --nsm "QBR engagement"
python execution/outcome-roadmap/scripts/roadmap_transformer.py outputs.json
```

### Pattern 5: Push to Linear (instead of Jira)

```bash
python execution/prioritization-frameworks/scripts/prioritization_scorer.py backlog.json \
  --framework rice --format linear | linear-cli issues create-batch --team PROD
python execution/status-update-generator/scripts/status_generator.py issues.json \
  --format linear --output status.md
```

### Pattern 6: Push to Notion DB

```bash
python execution/create-prd/scripts/prd_scaffolder.py \
  --product-name "Shared Dashboards" --format notion --output prd.md
# Then post to Notion API via notion-pm/ patterns
```

## Career Track Usage Patterns

### Pattern: Interview Prep
```
career/pm-interview-prep/ → frame question type → use CIRCLES/AARM/STAR → practice with mocks
```

### Pattern: Promo Cycle
```
career/pm-career-ladder/ → assess against rubric → identify gaps → 90-day growth plan → promo packet
```

### Pattern: New PM Onboarding
```
career/pm-onboarding/ → 30-60-90 day plan → stakeholder mapping (senior-pm/) → first PRD (create-prd/)
```
