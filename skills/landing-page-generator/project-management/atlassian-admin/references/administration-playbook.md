## Workflows

### User Provisioning
1. Receive request for new user access
2. Verify user identity and role
3. Create user account in organization
4. Add to appropriate groups (Jira users, Confluence users, etc.)
5. Assign product access (Jira, Confluence)
6. Configure default permissions
7. Send welcome email with onboarding info
8. **NOTIFY**: Relevant team leads of new member

### User Deprovisioning
1. Receive offboarding request
2. **CRITICAL**: Audit user's owned content and tickets
3. Reassign ownership of:
   - Jira projects
   - Confluence spaces
   - Open issues
   - Filters and dashboards
4. Remove from all groups
5. Revoke product access
6. Deactivate or delete account (per policy)
7. Document deprovisioning in audit log
8. **USE**: Jira Expert to reassign issues

### Group Management
1. Create groups based on:
   - Teams (engineering, product, sales)
   - Roles (admins, users, viewers)
   - Projects (project-alpha-team)
2. Define group purpose and membership criteria
3. Assign default permissions per group
4. Add users to appropriate groups
5. Regular review and cleanup (quarterly)
6. **USE**: Confluence Expert to document group structure

### Permission Scheme Design
**Jira Permission Schemes**:
- **Public Project**: All users can view, members can edit
- **Team Project**: Team members full access, stakeholders view
- **Restricted Project**: Named individuals only
- **Admin Project**: Admins only

**Confluence Permission Schemes**:
- **Public Space**: All users view, space members edit
- **Team Space**: Team-specific access
- **Personal Space**: Individual user only
- **Restricted Space**: Named individuals and groups

**Best Practices**:
- Use groups, not individual permissions
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular permission audits
- Document permission rationale

2. Configure SAML settings in Atlassian
3. Test SSO with admin account
4. Test with regular user account

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| SSO login fails intermittently for some users | SAML assertion clock skew, certificate expiration, or IdP session timeout mismatch | Check IdP and Atlassian server time sync (NTP); verify SAML certificate validity; align session timeout settings between IdP and Atlassian |
| Users cannot access products after provisioning | SCIM sync delay, group membership not propagated, or product access not granted | Verify SCIM provisioning logs; manually check group membership; confirm product access is assigned (not just org access) |
| Marketplace app causes performance degradation | App consuming excessive API calls, memory leaks, or incompatible with current Atlassian version | Check app-specific logs and resource usage; contact vendor for known issues; disable app temporarily and measure performance delta |
| Backup restoration fails or produces incomplete data | Backup file corrupted, version mismatch between backup and target instance, or attachments excluded | Verify backup integrity checksums; ensure target instance version matches; confirm backup includes attachments and active storage |
| Permission scheme changes do not take effect immediately | Browser cache, Jira index lag, or scheme not associated with the correct project | Clear browser cache; trigger a manual reindex; verify scheme-to-project association in project settings |
| API rate limits hit during automation | Too many concurrent API calls from automation rules, scripts, or integrations | Implement rate limiting and retry logic in scripts; stagger automation rule execution; consider Atlassian Forge for higher limits |
| Audit log gaps for critical admin actions | Audit logging level too low, or retention policy purging logs before review | Enable comprehensive audit logging; set retention to meet compliance requirements (minimum 1 year); export logs to SIEM for long-term storage |

## Success Criteria
