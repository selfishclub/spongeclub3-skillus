# Round Types, Frameworks, Level Calibration & Prep Playbook

Read this when you need the five round-type reference, the full CIRCLES / AARM / STAR / Estimation frameworks, the per-level calibration tables, the prep workflow, sample question excerpts, troubleshooting, or success criteria.

## The Five Round Types

| Round | Tests | Typical Length | Primary Framework |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Product Sense (Design) | Customer empathy, problem framing, creative solutioning, prioritization | 45-60 min | CIRCLES (Lin) |
| Product Improvement | Metric diagnosis, root-cause analysis, solution generation | 45-60 min | AARM |
| Strategy | Market analysis, competitive positioning, go-to-market thinking | 45-60 min | Porter / 3Cs / Ansoff |
| Behavioral | Leadership, influence, conflict, impact storytelling | 45-60 min | STAR |
| Technical / Analytical | Systems thinking, data fluency, SQL, A/B test design, estimation | 45-60 min | Estimation 5-step / metric trees |

Not every loop covers all five. APM loops emphasize product sense and behavioral. Senior PM loops emphasize strategy and execution. Group PM loops emphasize cross-team strategy and people leadership.

## Framework 1: CIRCLES (Product Sense)

Lewis Lin's CIRCLES Method from *Decode and Conquer* is the canonical product design framework.

| Step | Question | Time |
|------|----------|------|
| **C**omprehend | Clarify the scope, constraints, and goals of the question. Ask 2-3 clarifying questions. | 3-5 min |
| **I**dentify the customer | Pick a specific user segment. Justify why. | 2-3 min |
| **R**eport customer needs | List 3-5 needs of the chosen segment. Categorize by JTBD or pain/gain. | 5-7 min |
| **C**ut through prioritization | Pick 1-2 top needs to solve. Justify with a criterion (impact, frequency, severity, strategic fit). | 3-5 min |
| **L**ist solutions | Generate 3-5 distinct solutions for the prioritized need. Include at least one creative/non-obvious idea. | 8-10 min |
| **E**valuate trade-offs | Compare solutions on impact, effort, risk, and strategic fit. | 5-7 min |
| **S**ummarize | State your recommendation, the why, and the next step. | 2 min |

**Common failure modes:**

- Skipping Comprehend (jumping to solutions before scope is clear)
- Picking "all users" as the segment (no segmentation = no signal of customer empathy)
- Listing 10 generic solutions instead of 3-5 distinct ones
- Forgetting to summarize (interviewer leaves without a clear answer)

## Framework 2: AARM (Product Improvement / Metric Diagnosis)

For "How would you improve X?" or "Why is metric Y down?" questions:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **A**lign on the goal | Confirm what "improve" means: revenue? engagement? retention? satisfaction? |
| **A**nalyze the current state | Map the funnel or user journey. Identify drop-off points or weak metrics. |
| **R**ecommend interventions | Propose 2-3 interventions targeting the weakest step. Tie each to a measurable outcome. |
| **M**easure success | Define the success metric, guardrail metrics, and how you would A/B test. |

AARM forces the candidate to ground recommendations in data, not opinion. It also signals senior-level instincts (guardrails, measurement) that distinguish PM from Senior PM.

## Framework 3: STAR (Behavioral)

Standard but worth re-stating because most candidates do it poorly.

| Component | Length | Common Mistake |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **S**ituation | 30s | Spending 3 minutes on context |
| **T**ask | 30s | Burying the "what was your job" in narrative |
| **A**ction | 2-3 min | Saying "we" instead of "I" -- interviewers cannot grade the team |
| **R**esult | 1 min | No quantified outcome; no "what I learned" |

**Senior PM and above:** Add a 5th element -- **Reflection.** What would you do differently? What did this teach you about your leadership style? This signals self-awareness.

**Prepare 8-12 stories** that cover the canonical behavioral themes:

1. Time you influenced without authority
2. Time you disagreed with your manager
3. Time you killed a feature/project
4. Time you handled a major mistake
5. Time you turned around a struggling project
6. Time you said no to a stakeholder
7. Time you missed a deadline
8. Most ambitious project / biggest impact
9. Time you worked with a difficult cross-functional partner
10. Time you mentored or developed someone (Senior+)
11. Time you built or evolved team processes (Senior+)
12. Time you set strategy that others adopted (Group+)

## Framework 4: Estimation (Market Sizing)

Five-step framework for "How many X are sold in Y per year?" questions:

1. **Clarify scope** -- Geographic boundary, time period, what counts as X.
2. **Pick an approach** -- Top-down (start from population) or bottom-up (start from units). State which and why.
3. **Decompose** -- Break the calculation into 3-5 multiplied factors. Each factor is something you can estimate within an order of magnitude.
4. **Estimate each factor** -- State your assumption and justify it briefly. Use round numbers.
5. **Sanity check** -- Compare the result to a known benchmark. State whether the answer feels high, low, or right and why.

**Example:** Yearly coffee cups sold in San Francisco.

- Scope: SF city (not Bay Area), 12 months, includes home + cafe.
- Approach: Bottom-up via population x cups-per-day.
- Decompose: Population (850K) x % coffee drinkers (60%) x cups/day (2) x 365 = ~370M cups/year.
- Sanity check: SF has ~1,500 coffee shops; if each sells 500/day = 275M shop cups/year. Plus home consumption (~30% of total). Total feels right.

## Level Calibration

Same question, different bar by level:

### Product sense ("Design a product for X")

| Level | Bar |
|-------|-----|
| APM | Picks a clear segment, lists 3 reasonable solutions, summarizes a pick |
| PM | + Articulates trade-offs, considers measurement, surfaces a non-obvious solution |
| Senior PM | + Connects to a business goal, considers downstream eng/design effort, names a v2/v3 path |
| Group PM | + Frames the opportunity strategically, identifies platform / cross-team implications, designs the operating cadence to learn fast |

### Behavioral ("Tell me about a time you...")

| Level | Bar |
|-------|-----|
| APM | Clean STAR, quantified result, owns their part |
| PM | + Shows judgment under uncertainty, surfaces what they learned |
| Senior PM | + Demonstrates influence at the org level, names trade-offs and counterfactuals |
| Group PM | + Demonstrates org-design / people leadership, story spans quarters not weeks |

### Strategy ("How would you grow product X?")

| Level | Bar |
|-------|-----|
| APM | Usually not asked this round |
| PM | Maps growth levers using a known framework (AARRR, Ansoff) |
| Senior PM | + Identifies the highest-leverage lever with reasoning, considers competitor response |
| Group PM | + Defines the operating system to run the strategy (teams, metrics, cadence, decision rights) |

## Workflow

1. **Diagnose your starting point.** Use `assets/self_assessment.md` to rate yourself across the five round types. Identify your weakest two.
2. **Build a question bank.** Use `references/question-bank.md` to pull 5-10 questions per round type targeted at your level.
3. **Practice solo first.** For each question, write a structured answer using the appropriate framework. Time yourself.
4. **Mock with a peer.** Schedule 2-3 mocks per round type. Use `assets/mock_feedback_form.md` for structured feedback.
5. **Refine stories.** Rewrite the 8-12 behavioral stories until each is under 5 minutes and quantified. Practice the opening line of each.
6. **Final week prep.** Re-read the company's product, recent press, and any teardown. Prepare 2-3 thoughtful questions to ask each interviewer.

## Question Banks (Excerpt -- see references/question-bank.md for full set)

### Product Sense

- "Design a product for a deaf person to navigate a city."
- "How would you redesign the airport experience for elderly travelers?"
- "Design a new feature for Spotify that drives daily engagement."

### Product Improvement

- "Why are Instagram Stories views down 5%?"
- "How would you improve Google Maps for commuters?"
- "How would you increase host signups on Airbnb?"

### Strategy

- "Should Netflix enter gaming?"
- "How should Shopify defend against Amazon's small-business push?"
- "What is the most important metric for Slack and why?"

### Behavioral

- See the 12-story prompt list above.

### Technical / Analytical

- "Estimate the storage cost of YouTube."
- "Design an A/B test for a new checkout flow. What is the minimum sample size?"
- "Walk me through how you would diagnose a 20% spike in API errors."

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| You run out of time in product sense rounds | Spending too long in Comprehend or List Solutions | Allocate time per CIRCLES step and self-monitor; aim for solutions in 25 min, summary in 5 min |
| Interviewer keeps asking "and why?" follow-ups | Answers lack reasoning chains | Every answer should include the rationale -- "I picked X because Y, with trade-off Z"; explicitly state trade-offs unprompted |
| Behavioral stories sound generic | STAR is too high-level; "we" instead of "I"; no quantification | Rewrite to be specific to one event; replace "we" with "I"; add 1-2 numbers per story |
| You blank on the metric question | No mental model of the product's metric tree | Before the interview, sketch the product's likely metric tree (NSM + input metrics); rehearse 2-3 diagnostic patterns |
| Estimation answers are off by 100x | Skipping the sanity check step | Always compare to a known benchmark (population, GDP, daily users) before stating the final number |
| You feel under-leveled in feedback | Examples scoped too small (project-level for a Senior role) | Pick larger-scope stories that span multiple teams or quarters; for Group PM, lead with stories about org design, not feature design |
| You over-prepared frameworks but bombed | Robotic delivery; framework became scaffolding visible to interviewer | Use frameworks invisibly -- never name CIRCLES out loud; let the structure show through your answer, not your vocabulary |

## Success Criteria

- You have a structured answer template for each of the five round types
- You have 8-12 behavioral stories written, timed under 5 minutes each
- You have completed >=2 mocks per round type with structured feedback
- You can run CIRCLES end-to-end on a novel question in under 45 minutes
- You can do market sizing within 10 minutes including sanity check
- You have 2-3 thoughtful questions prepared for each interviewer
- You know the level-appropriate bar -- you are not under-scoping (sounds like an APM in a Sr PM loop) or over-scoping (sounds like a Director in a PM loop)
