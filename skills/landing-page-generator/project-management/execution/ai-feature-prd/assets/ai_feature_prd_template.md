## 9. AI System Design

### 9.1 Model selection rationale

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary model | [vendor + model + version, e.g. `claude-sonnet-4.5` via Anthropic API] |
| Fallback model | [vendor + model + version] |
| Reason for primary | [Eval performance, cost, safety profile, latency] |
| Switch trigger to fallback | [Outage; cost overrun; eval regression] |
| Update / re-evaluation policy | Every 90 days against new releases |
| Vendor / data-residency considerations | [DPA in place? Region? Training opt-out confirmed?] |

### 9.2 Architecture pattern

Pattern chosen: [ ] Prompt only [ ] Few-shot [ ] RAG [ ] Fine-tune (SFT) [ ] RLHF / preference [ ] Agentic / tool use

| Pattern | Considered? | Why chosen / rejected |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt only | Yes / No | |
| Few-shot | Yes / No | |
| RAG | Yes / No | |
| Fine-tune (SFT) | Yes / No | |
| RLHF / preference | Yes / No | |
| Agentic | Yes / No | |

### 9.3 Data flow

[Diagram or describe: input -> preprocessing -> (retrieval?) -> model -> postprocessing -> output. Mark trust boundaries.]

| Aspect | Approach |
|---|---|
| User data leaving the boundary | [What goes to which vendor under which DPA] |
| PII handling | [Redacted? Hashed? Tokenized? Excluded from logs?] |
| Retention | [User input retention; output retention; training-data opt-out] |
| Logging | [What is logged, for how long, who can access] |

### 9.4 Prompt contract

```
[Sketch the system prompt structure. Production prompt lives in source control under prompts/<feature>/v<n>.txt with PR review.]
```

## 10. Eval & Safety Plan

### 10.1 Eval criteria

| Metric | Target | Method | Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acceptance rate | >= [%] | [Rubric / pairwise / LLM-as-judge] | Weekly |
| Hallucination rate | <= [%] | [Faithfulness / RAGAS / rubric] | Weekly |
| Refusal rate (benign) | <= [%] | Benign-set eval | Pre-launch + monthly |
| Refusal rate (harmful) | >= [%] | Red-team set | Pre-launch + on prompt change |
| p95 latency | < [ms] | Production telemetry | Continuous |
| Cost per interaction | < $[X] | Token accounting | Continuous |
| Win-rate vs baseline | > [%] | Pairwise | Before each model/prompt change |
| Format compliance | >= [%] | Auto-validation | Every release |
| Format-compliant output schema | [JSON schema link or inline] | -- | -- |

Eval tooling: [Promptfoo / Langfuse / Anthropic Console / Braintrust / OpenAI Evals / RAGAS / other]

### 10.2 Golden set

- **Size:** [N examples]
- **Composition:** [70% common / 20% edge / 10% adversarial -- adjust if needed]
- **Source:** [Production logs / user research / synthesized + human-reviewed]
- **Ownership:** PM owns the set; ML owns the run; both review failures weekly
- **Location:** [Source control path]
- **Refresh cadence:** [Quarterly; replace 10-20% of items]

### 10.3 Guardrails

| Layer | What it does | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Input filter | [Intent classification, PII strip, scope check] | [Tool / regex / classifier] |
| Pre-prompt | [System-prompt constraints] | [Reference prompt path] |
| In-model | [Choice of well-aligned model] | [Model name] |
| Output filter | [Content classification, PII, jailbreak-success] | [Tool] |
| Post-response | [Schema validation, citation check] | [Code path] |
| Human-in-loop | [Escalation queue trigger] | [Threshold + destination] |

### 10.4 Refusal policy

**Always refuse:**
- [Category + 2-3 concrete examples]

**Redirect / disclaim:**
- [Category + behavior]

**Clarify before answering:**
- [Category + behavior]

**Answer plainly:**
- [Everything not covered above]

Refusal-policy ownership: [Safety reviewer name]. Policy reviewed every [cadence].

### 10.5 Failure modes & graceful degradation

| Failure | Detection | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Primary model outage | Health check + error rate | Failover to fallback; degrade features |
| Quality regression | Eval CI alert | Roll back prompt/model; notify on-call |
| Hallucination spike | Faithfulness eval + user reports | Tighten retrieval; add citation requirement |
| Jailbreak success | Red-team monitor + output filter | Add to red-team set; patch system prompt |
| Cost spike | Per-tenant token meter | Throttle; downgrade model |
| Latency spike | p95 alert | Reduce context; cache; pre-warm |
| Drift | Online sampling | Re-evaluate model; refresh golden set |

### 10.6 Human-in-the-loop checkpoints

- **Hard gates** (never auto-execute): [List high-stakes actions]
- **Soft gates** (low-confidence -> review queue): [Confidence threshold + destination]
- **Sampling review:** [N%] of production traffic, [cadence], by [reviewer]
- **Escalation triggers:** [Explicit "I don't know"; repeat dissatisfaction; off-topic]

### 10.7 Ethical review checklist

- [ ] We identified who could be harmed by this feature.
- [ ] We tested with users from affected demographic groups.
- [ ] We considered the cost of a wrong answer in this domain.
- [ ] EU AI Act risk tier declared: [Minimal / Limited / High / Unacceptable] -- see `ra-qm-team/eu-ai-act-specialist/`.
- [ ] GDPR / HIPAA / COPPA / ADA reviewed for the data flow.
- [ ] Training-data provenance documented (if fine-tuning).
- [ ] Users informed they are interacting with AI.
- [ ] Non-AI alternative or escape hatch available.
- [ ] Disparate-impact subgroup eval planned.

## 11. Operations & Cost

### 11.1 Cost model

| Cost line | Formula | Estimate at scale |
|---|---|---|
| Inference (primary) | requests/mo x avg_tokens x $/token | $ |
| Inference (fallback) | <= 10% of primary | $ |
| Vector store / retrieval | docs x dimension x $/GB-mo | $ |
| Eval runs | golden_set x runs x $/call | $ |
| Human review | hours x rate | $ |
| Logging / observability | events/mo x $/event | $ |
| **Total** | | $ |

Use `engineering/llm-cost-optimizer/` to model variance.

### 11.2 Cost monitoring

- Per-tenant token meter; alert at 80%, auto-throttle at 120%.
- Daily cost dashboard.
- Cost-per-successful-interaction (CSI) tracked weekly.
- Variance review every Monday.

### 11.3 Deployment ramp

| Stage | Audience | Gate to next |
|---|---|---|
| Shadow | Mirrored traffic, no user output | Eval bar met; no crashes |
| Internal | Employees + invited testers | Acceptance >= 85%; no P0 safety incidents in 1 week |
| Canary | 1-5% of users | Acceptance >= 90%; cost in range; no regression |
| Percent rollout | 10% -> 25% -> 50% | Each step held >= 3 days; metrics within bounds |
| GA | 100% | Stable for 2 weeks; runbook in place |

Pair with `feature-flag-strategy/` for flag mechanics.

### 11.4 Lifecycle

- **Model refresh:** Re-evaluate primary against alternatives every 90 days.
- **Prompt versioning:** Every prompt change has a PR, an eval delta, a rollback path.
- **Golden-set refresh:** Replace 10-20% of items quarterly.
- **Deprecation / sunset:** [Criteria for sunsetting this feature or migrating to a new model.]

## Appendix A: Glossary

- **Golden set** -- a curated dataset used to measure quality consistently across model/prompt changes.
