# Refinement Playbook: INVEST, Splitting, DoR/DoD, Workflow

Read this when you need the full operating detail of a refinement session — the INVEST scoring table, the 9 vertical-splitting recipes, the Definition of Ready / Definition of Done templates, the step-by-step workflow, the tool reference, troubleshooting, and success criteria.

## The INVEST Criteria

Bill Wake's INVEST acronym (2003) defines the six properties of a high-quality story:

| Letter | Property | What it means | Quick test |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **I** | **Independent** | Can be delivered without waiting for another story | "Can this ship alone? If no, what is the dependency?" |
| **N** | **Negotiable** | Implementation is open to discussion | "Does this prescribe HOW, or only WHAT and WHY?" |
| **V** | **Valuable** | Delivers value to a user or business | "If we built only this and nothing else, who benefits?" |
| **E** | **Estimable** | The team can size effort with reasonable confidence | "Can two engineers independently estimate within ~2x?" |
| **S** | **Small** | Fits within one sprint (typically 1-5 days of effort) | "Can a pair finish this in <5 days?" |
| **T** | **Testable** | Acceptance criteria are observable and verifiable | "How would QA prove this is done?" |

A story scoring 6/6 is sprint-ready. A story scoring 5/6 with a soft fail on one criterion is usually safe to admit if the team agrees on the gap. Anything 4 or below needs a refinement pass.

## Vertical Slicing and Story Splitting

The most common refinement failure is **horizontal slicing** -- splitting a story by layer (DB, API, UI, infra) rather than by user outcome. Horizontal slices fail INVEST-V (no slice delivers user value alone) and INVEST-I (every slice depends on the others).

**Vertical slices** cut through every layer to deliver an end-to-end thin sliver of user value. Each slice is independently shippable and independently valuable.

### The 9 splitting recipes (Richard Lawrence)

Richard Lawrence's Story Splitting Flowchart enumerates 9 reliable patterns. Use them in this priority order:

| # | Pattern | Use when | Example |
|---|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Workflow steps** | The story spans a multi-step process | "Checkout" → "Add to cart" / "Pay" / "Confirm" |
| 2 | **Business rule variations** | The story covers many rules | "Discount" → "Loyalty discount" / "Volume discount" / "Promo code" |
| 3 | **Happy / unhappy paths** | Error handling adds complexity | "Submit form" → "Submit valid form" / "Handle validation errors" |
| 4 | **Input options / platforms** | Multiple inputs or platforms | "Search" → "Search via keyword" / "Search via filters" / "Search via voice" |
| 5 | **Data types or parameters** | Multiple data variations | "Export report" → "Export CSV" / "Export PDF" / "Export XLSX" |
| 6 | **Operations (CRUD)** | The story covers multiple ops | "Manage users" → "Create user" / "Edit user" / "Delete user" |
| 7 | **Test scenarios / cases** | Test plan reveals natural splits | "Login" → "Login with email" / "Login with SSO" / "Login with MFA" |
| 8 | **Defer performance** | The simple version works | "Search 1M records" → "Search basic" (v1) / "Optimize search" (v2) |
| 9 | **Spike (last resort)** | The team cannot estimate | A time-boxed investigation, then re-split |

### The SPIDR alternative (Mike Cohn)

Mike Cohn's SPIDR mnemonic covers a similar space with five buckets: **S**pikes, **P**aths, **I**nterfaces, **D**ata, **R**ules. Use whichever taxonomy your team finds memorable; the patterns overlap.

### Splitting anti-patterns to avoid

- **Splitting by layer.** "Backend API" / "Frontend UI" / "Database migration" are tasks, not stories. They violate INVEST-V.
- **Splitting by team.** If only "the backend team" can deliver a slice, the slice is not independently valuable.
- **Splitting by sprint.** Forcing a 10-day story into "Sprint 1 part" and "Sprint 2 part" is scheduling, not splitting.
- **Splitting too thin.** A 2-hour story is not a story; it is a task. Roll it back up.

## Definition of Ready (DoR)

The DoR is the team's agreement on what a story must satisfy before it can enter a sprint. It is the **input quality gate**.

### Recommended DoR template

A story is Ready when:

- [ ] Title is descriptive and specific (no "Implement X")
- [ ] Why statement references a specific objective, OKR, or customer outcome
- [ ] Description is 1-2 paragraphs and serves as a reminder of the refinement discussion
- [ ] Acceptance criteria: at least 4, each describing an observable user-facing outcome
- [ ] INVEST score >= 5/6 (verified by `refinement_scorer.py` or facilitated review)
- [ ] Dependencies on other stories or teams are identified and noted
- [ ] Design assets linked (or marked "TBD by [date]" with owner)
- [ ] Estimated by the team using their preferred unit (story points, t-shirt, days)
- [ ] No open blocker questions
- [ ] Tagged with sprint goal it contributes to

### DoR anti-patterns

- **Too strict** -- a 20-item DoR creates a backlog of "almost ready" stories. Cap at 10.
- **Unenforced** -- a DoR that planning ignores is theater. Enforce: stories that fail DoR are removed from the sprint candidate list, not "negotiated in."
- **One-size-fits-all** -- spikes, bugs, and feature stories have different DoRs. Keep three short checklists rather than one long one.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

The DoD is the team's agreement on what a story must satisfy before it can be called complete. It is the **output quality gate** and is typically uniform across all stories.

### Recommended DoD template

A story is Done when:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass in the deployed environment
- [ ] Code merged to main branch (or release branch per release process)
- [ ] Automated tests written and passing (unit + integration for changed paths)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by at least one other engineer
- [ ] Manual QA pass (or QA sign-off if separate QA exists)
- [ ] Documentation updated (help center, internal runbook, API docs, as applicable)
- [ ] Feature flag wired (if behind a flag) or release-notes entry drafted
- [ ] Analytics or telemetry events instrumented (so we can measure the outcome)
- [ ] Accessibility check pass (WCAG AA for user-facing UI)
- [ ] Product owner has accepted the story

### DoD anti-patterns

- **"Done" but not deployed** -- a story that is merged but not in front of a user is not done. Require deployment in the DoD.
- **No instrumentation** -- shipping without telemetry means you cannot measure the outcome. Require analytics for any value-claim story.
- **Skipping accessibility** -- a11y debt compounds. Require WCAG AA on every user-facing change.

## Workflow

1. **Pull candidates from the backlog.** Aim for 1.5x the team's velocity in candidates per refinement session.
2. **Score each candidate with `refinement_scorer.py`.** Use `--input backlog.json --format markdown` to get a per-story INVEST grade.
3. **Triage by score:**
   - **5-6:** Promote to "Refined" lane.
   - **3-4:** Discuss in session, address the failing criteria.
   - **0-2:** Send back to discovery (`discovery/brainstorm-ideas/` or `discovery/identify-assumptions/`) -- the work has not been scoped enough.
4. **Split oversized stories.** Apply the 9 Lawrence patterns in priority order. Each new slice must independently pass INVEST-V and INVEST-S.
5. **Enforce the DoR.** Anything failing DoR at planning is removed from the candidate list, not "negotiated in."
6. **Enforce the DoD at review.** Stories that miss any DoD bullet are not "almost done" -- they roll to the next sprint.
7. **Hand off refined stories to sprint planning.** A well-refined backlog reduces planning to: pick the top N stories that fit capacity.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Command |
|------|---------|---------|
| `refinement_scorer.py` | Grade stories against INVEST and emit readiness verdicts | `python scripts/refinement_scorer.py --input backlog.json --format markdown` |
| `refinement_scorer.py --demo` | Inspect demo data and output format | `python scripts/refinement_scorer.py --demo --format markdown` |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Refinement sessions run long and produce few refined stories | Too many candidates per session; team trying to refine everything at once | Cap at 1.5x velocity in candidates; spend max 2 minutes per story on initial INVEST grade; deep-refine only those scoring 3-4 |
| Same stories appear in 3+ refinement sessions without progress | Story is too vague; team lacks information; or story belongs in discovery | Apply the "3-strike rule" -- if a story fails to refine three sessions in a row, send to `discovery/identify-assumptions/` to reframe |
| Sprint planning becomes the refinement session | DoR is not enforced; pressure to "make the sprint full" overrides quality | Empower the team to leave the sprint under-full rather than admit DoR-failing stories; track planning duration as a velocity proxy |
| Splits produce horizontal slices (API / UI / DB) | Team defaults to architecture decomposition; PM does not push back | Use the 9 Lawrence patterns explicitly; require each slice to answer "who benefits if this is the only thing we ship?" |
| Stories pass DoD but value does not materialize | Acceptance criteria describe activity, not outcome; no telemetry | Rewrite acceptance criteria as observable user outcomes; require telemetry/analytics in the DoD |
| Estimates vary wildly across the team | INVEST-Estimable failure; story too vague or too large | Re-refine with a spike if needed; split into smaller slices that two engineers can size within 2x of each other |
| `refinement_scorer.py` gives 6/6 but story still feels risky | Score covers form, not substance; risk is in the assumptions, not the format | Use `discovery/identify-assumptions/` and `discovery/pre-mortem/` for substantive risk; INVEST is necessary but not sufficient |

## Success Criteria

- 80%+ of stories entering sprint planning score 5/6 or 6/6 on INVEST
- Refinement session length stays under 60 minutes per week, per team
- DoR and DoD are reviewed and updated at least once per quarter
- Story splits produce vertical slices in 90%+ of cases (each slice independently valuable)
- Sprint planning meetings take less than half the duration of refinement (because refinement did the work)
- Rolled-over story rate (stories that miss the sprint) below 15% sustained
- Stories scoring below 3 on INVEST are sent back to discovery rather than forced into a sprint

## Tool Reference

### refinement_scorer.py

Grades each story in a JSON backlog file against the six INVEST criteria and emits a readiness score (0-6) per story plus an aggregate readiness summary for the backlog.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--input` | string | (required unless `--demo`) | Path to JSON file containing backlog items |
| `--demo` | flag | false | Use built-in demo backlog data |
| `--format` | choice | markdown | Output format: json, markdown, mermaid, confluence, notion, linear |
| `--output` | string | stdout | Output file path |
| `--threshold` | int | 5 | Minimum score for a story to be flagged "READY" (default 5/6) |

### Input JSON shape

```json
{
  "stories": [
    {
      "id": "STORY-1",
      "title": "Add SSO login for enterprise users",
      "why": "Enterprise customers cite missing SSO as the #1 blocker; supports $2M ARR expansion target",
      "what": "Add SAML 2.0 SSO option to the login page. Users with company email domains see SSO as the primary login method; password login remains as fallback.",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Users with configured domains see SSO as primary login option",
        "SAML 2.0 IdP-initiated flow works for Okta and Azure AD",
        "Failed SSO falls back to password with helpful error",
        "Audit log records every SSO login attempt"
      ],
      "estimate_days": 4,
      "has_design": true,
