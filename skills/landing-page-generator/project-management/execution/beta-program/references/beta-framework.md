# Closed Beta Framework, Workflow & Troubleshooting

Read this when you are building the beta plan, setting exit gates, running the weekly cadence, or diagnosing a beta that is going sideways. Contains the full framework tables (cohorts, Kano scope, success gates, cadence, exit gates), the step-by-step workflow, the troubleshooting matrix, and success criteria moved verbatim from `SKILL.md`.

## The Closed Beta Framework

### Cohort Design: Friends, Family, Fanatics

A widely-used pattern (popularized by early-stage operators including Y Combinator partners) for sequencing beta recruitment in three concentric rings of decreasing trust and increasing signal.

| Cohort | Who | Goal | Typical Size | Tolerance for Rough Edges |
|--------|-----|------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Friends** | Internal employees, advisors, immediate network | Find the worst bugs without reputational risk | 5-10 | Very high |
| **Family** | Existing customers who explicitly opted in, design partners | Validate the workflow fits real jobs and produces value | 10-20 | High |
| **Fanatics** | Cold-recruited prospects matching the ICP who actively want to solve the problem | Validate that the feature drives acquisition, not just retention | 10-15 | Medium |

Run the cohorts sequentially (Friends -> Family -> Fanatics) or with deliberate overlap. Do not skip Friends to "save time" -- this is where every embarrassing crash should surface.

### Kano Model for Beta Scope

Use the Kano model (Noriaki Kano, 1984) to decide what is in scope for the beta build:

| Kano Category | Definition | Beta Decision |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Must-be** | Basic expectations; absence causes immediate dissatisfaction | Must be present and stable on day 1 of beta |
| **Performance** | More-is-better attributes that scale with investment | Include enough to demonstrate the value curve |
| **Delight** | Unexpected features that produce strong positive reactions | Pick 1-2 delight features for the beta -- this is where you generate quotes for the launch |
| **Indifferent** | Features the user does not care about | Cut from beta scope; revisit post-GA |
| **Reverse** | Features that some users actively dislike | Make them opt-in; track who turns them off |

The most common mistake is shipping a beta with only Must-be features. Without at least one Delight feature, your beta produces neutral feedback and no quotable testimonials.

### Beta Success Criteria (Set Before Recruitment)

Define quantitative and qualitative gates before opening recruitment. If you set them after the beta starts, they will be rationalized to match what you already see.

| Gate Type | Example Metric | Example Target |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Activation** | % of beta users who reach the first key action within 7 days | >= 70% |
| **Engagement** | Median sessions per active beta user per week | >= 3 |
| **Retention** | % of beta users still active in week 4 | >= 60% |
| **Outcome** | % of beta users who achieve the headline outcome (saves X minutes, reduces Y, etc.) | >= 50% |
| **NPS / CSAT** | Net Promoter Score within the beta cohort | >= 30 |
| **Crash-free sessions** | Crash-free session rate across beta | >= 99.5% |
| **P0 bug count** | Open P0 bugs at exit-gate review | 0 |
| **Quotable testimonials** | Named customers willing to be quoted in launch materials | >= 3 |

### Weekly Communication Cadence

A beta dies of silence. Commit to a weekly rhythm and publish it to participants on day 1.

| Day | Action | Owner |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **Monday** | Weekly digest to participants: what shipped, known issues, what to try this week | PM |
| **Tuesday** | Office hours (30 min open Zoom or async thread) | PM + Eng Lead |
| **Wednesday** | Internal beta health review: metrics, bugs, themes | PM |
| **Thursday** | One-on-one with rotating subset (2-3 participants/week) | PM or PMM |
| **Friday** | Weekly metrics snapshot posted to participants Slack/Discord | PM |

### Beta-to-GA Exit Gates

At the end of the planned beta window (typically 4-8 weeks), run an exit-gate review against the pre-agreed criteria. There are exactly four outcomes:

1. **Greenlight GA** -- All gates met. Proceed to launch using `launch-playbook/`.
2. **Extend beta** -- Most gates met, 1-2 gaps with a clear plan to close in 2-4 more weeks.
3. **Pivot** -- Engagement/outcome gates failed; usage pattern reveals a different job-to-be-done. Rewrite the PRD.
4. **Kill** -- Both engagement and outcome gates failed with no compelling alternative pattern. Write the postmortem and free the team.

The decision should be made by the DACI driver (see `daci-framework/`) with documented input from engineering, design, marketing, and at least one beta participant.

## Workflow

1. **Frame the beta.** Define the hypothesis, the target cohort definition, and the headline outcome you expect beta users to achieve. Reference the PRD from `create-prd/`.
2. **Set exit gates.** Fill in `assets/beta-program-plan.md` with quantitative and qualitative gates. Get explicit sign-off from PM, Engineering, and the executive sponsor.
3. **Build the recruitment funnel.** Use `assets/recruitment-script.md` to draft outreach for each of the three cohorts. Aim to over-recruit by 2x (expect 50% activation).
4. **Stand up the participant comms channel.** Slack Connect, Discord, or shared email list. Publish the weekly cadence on day 1.
5. **Run the cadence.** Hold weekly Monday digests, Tuesday office hours, Wednesday internal reviews, Thursday 1:1s, Friday metric snapshots. Use `assets/weekly-cadence-template.md`.
6. **Run the exit-gate review.** At week N, populate `assets/exit-memo.md` with actual data vs. each gate. The DACI driver picks one of the four outcomes.
7. **Communicate the decision.** Tell participants what happens next: GA timeline, extension plan, pivot, or sunset. Honor any commitments (early access, pricing, credits).
8. **Hand off to launch.** If greenlit, hand the beta artifacts (testimonials, case studies, known issues, gate data) to `launch-playbook/`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Recruitment misses target by >50% | Recruitment script led with features instead of the participant's pain; cohort definition too narrow | Rewrite outreach to lead with the problem and the participant's payoff; widen the cohort by one dimension (industry, role, or company size) |
| Engagement collapses after week 2 | No clear "what to try this week" prompt; users hit a rough edge and bounced | Re-establish the Monday digest with a specific weekly task; ship a hotfix for the top friction point within the same week |
| Beta participants stop responding to outreach | Cadence is too heavy or asks generic questions | Cut to one async ping per week with a specific question tied to that week's release; offer credits for completed feedback |
| Exit-gate metrics look good but team has no quotes | Beta lacked Delight features; outreach never asked for permission to quote | Add 1-2 Delight features in an extension week; explicitly ask for quotable testimonials in the week-3 1:1 |
| Exec sponsor pushes to skip exit gates and ship | Gates were set without sponsor buy-in; gates conflict with a hard launch date | Re-run the decision with the DACI driver; document the override and the risk in `assets/exit-memo.md` |
| Beta drags 12+ weeks with no decision | No pre-agreed exit window; team keeps adding scope | Enforce a 6-week default; any extension requires a written 2-week plan with measurable gates |
| Participants leak the beta publicly | NDA was implied, not explicit; participants felt the embargo was unfair | Send a one-page beta agreement at activation; offer an early-public-praise window in the final week to channel enthusiasm |

## Success Criteria

- Recruitment hits >= 100% of the planned cohort size across all three rings (Friends, Family, Fanatics).
- Exit-gate criteria are documented, quantitative, and signed off before recruitment opens.
- Weekly cadence runs every week of the beta with documented attendance and themes.
- At least 50% of activated participants achieve the headline outcome by the exit-gate review.
- The exit-gate review produces a single documented decision (Greenlight / Extend / Pivot / Kill) within 5 business days of beta end.
- At least 3 named participants agree to be quoted in launch materials.
- Beta artifacts (gate data, testimonials, known issues, customer requests) are handed off to the launch team in a single bundle.
