## The Three Launches Framework

Marty Cagan's "three launches" model (popularized in *Inspired*, 2008/2018) sequences a launch into three windows that test different risks.

| Launch | Audience | Primary Risk Tested | Typical Duration |
|--------|----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Alpha** | Internal employees, dogfooding | Does it work at all? | 1-2 weeks |
| **Beta** | 10-30 closed external participants | Does it produce the outcome? Is it stable? | 4-8 weeks (see `beta-program/`) |
| **GA (Launch)** | All target users | Does the market care? Can we scale? | The launch event + 30-day stabilization |

This skill focuses on the GA launch. Alpha lives with engineering; Beta lives in `beta-program/`. By the time you open this playbook, both should be complete or in their final week.

## The Launch Timeline (T-30 to T+30)

### Pre-Launch (T-30 to T-1)

| Day | Workstream | Action |
|----:|-----------|--------|
| T-30 | All | Kickoff: confirm date, owner per workstream, exec sponsor |
| T-30 | PM + PMM | Positioning brief signed off |
| T-21 | Eng | Code freeze decision; rollout strategy (big bang vs progressive) confirmed |
| T-21 | Support | Runbook drafted; FAQ in progress |
| T-21 | Sales | Enablement deck drafted; pricing finalized |
| T-14 | Legal | Final review of public-facing copy, ToS changes, pricing pages |
| T-14 | Marketing | Press release, blog post, social copy, email campaign drafted |
| T-10 | Eng | Dark launch / feature flag toggled for internal verification |
| T-7 | All | Dry-run of the launch-day run-of-show; rollback drill |
| T-7 | Support | Team training completed; runbook published |
| T-7 | Sales | Reps trained; battle cards distributed |
| T-3 | All | Final go/no-go check against launch readiness checklist |
| T-2 | Marketing | Embargoed press outreach |
| T-1 | All | Final confirmation; on-call rota for launch day published |

### Launch Day (T-0)

Run from a single shared document (the run-of-show). Hourly cadence. Single incident commander. See `assets/launch-run-of-show.md`.

### Post-Launch (T+1 to T+30)

| Day | Workstream | Action |
|----:|-----------|--------|
| T+1 | PM + Eng | War-room standup: metrics, incidents, customer sentiment |
| T+1 | PMM | Launch-day metrics report to exec sponsor |
| T+3 | Support | First-3-days ticket triage; identify themes |
| T+7 | PM | Week-1 retrospective using `assets/post-launch-retro.md` |
| T+14 | PMM | Press coverage roundup; first-2-weeks adoption report |
| T+30 | All | 30-day retrospective; long-term metrics vs forecast |
| T+30 | PM | Decision: invest more / sustain / sunset / iterate |

## Launch Type Selection

### Big Bang

Single date, all users, full announcement. Use when:

- The product is stable, tested, and beta gates were met cleanly.
- Marketing leverage of a single date is critical (e.g., conference keynote).
- No technical risk that benefits from gradual exposure.

### Progressive Rollout

Stage exposure by feature flag, geography, account tier, or random percentage. Use when:

- Performance or scale risk that cannot be tested in beta volume.
- New billing flow, payment system, or anything that could lose customer money on failure.
- Migration that needs a clear rollback path per cohort.

### Dark Launch

Code is in production behind a flag, exercising real traffic and infrastructure, but not visible to users. Use when:

- You need to validate infrastructure under real load before any user-visible change.
- The feature has expensive backend dependencies (database migrations, indexing, queue capacity).

The three are not mutually exclusive: dark-launch the backend, then progressive-rollout the UI, then big-bang the announcement.

## RACI Matrix for Launches

| Workstream | PM | Eng | PMM | Sales | Support | Legal | Exec |
|-----------|:--:|:---:|:---:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|:----:|
| Positioning & messaging | A | C | R | C | I | C | I |
| Code freeze & deployment | I | R/A | I | I | I | I | I |
| Sales enablement | C | I | R | A | I | I | I |
| Support runbook & training | C | C | I | I | R/A | I | I |
| Legal & compliance review | C | I | C | I | I | R/A | I |
| External comms (PR, blog, social) | I | I | R/A | I | I | C | I |
| Internal comms (all-hands, FAQ) | R/A | I | C | I | C | I | I |
| Launch day run-of-show | R/A | C | C | I | C | I | I |
| Rollback decision | C | C | I | I | I | I | A |
| 30-day retrospective | R/A | C | C | C | C | I | I |

R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed.

## Workflow

1. **Kickoff at T-30.** Confirm launch date, type (big bang / progressive / dark), and exec sponsor. Open `assets/launch-run-of-show.md` and `assets/internal-comms-plan.md`.
2. **Assign the RACI.** Every cell above is named within 48 hours of kickoff.
3. **Lock the positioning.** PMM owns; PM + Eng + Legal review. Signed off by T-21.
4. **Build the comms artifacts.** Internal comms plan (T-14), external comms checklist (T-10), customer email and press release (T-7).
5. **Test the rollback.** Engineering runs a rollback drill in staging by T-7. The result is documented in `assets/rollback-plan.md`.
6. **Run the dry-run.** At T-7, walk through the launch-day run-of-show with all owners present. Identify any unowned action.
7. **Go/no-go at T-3.** Use the launch-readiness checklist in `assets/external-comms-checklist.md`. Any "No" requires a documented mitigation or a launch postponement.
8. **Run launch day.** Single incident commander; hourly cadence; war room (physical or virtual) open from T-0 to end-of-day.
9. **Stabilize T+1 to T+7.** Daily war-room standup; rapid hotfix lane open; sales and support triage themes.
10. **Run the 30-day retro.** Use `assets/post-launch-retro.md`. Decide: invest more, sustain, iterate, or sunset.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Launch date slips repeatedly | Beta gates were not actually met; team launching on the calendar instead of the criteria | Reopen the beta exit memo from `beta-program/`; re-baseline date based on actual gate status |
| Sales has no idea the feature exists on launch day | Enablement workstream not assigned an owner; PMM assumed Sales would self-serve from the blog post | Add a named Sales Enablement Lead in the RACI by T-21; mandatory training session in week T-1 |
| Support overwhelmed in first 48 hours | Runbook published too late, no T-7 training, no on-call rota | Make Support runbook + training a T-7 launch gate; require named on-call schedule in the run-of-show |
| Press coverage misrepresents the feature | Embargoed materials skipped or PMM and PM had different messaging | Single shared positioning brief signed off by T-21; PMM-led press briefings only; one PR contact for all journalists |
| Rollback "tested" but fails in production | Drill was performed in staging with synthetic data; production differences not exercised | Run a production rollback drill (with a no-op feature) at T-14; document the result in `assets/rollback-plan.md` |
| Exec sponsor hears about a customer issue before hearing about the launch | No internal comms plan; #launches Slack channel never existed | Internal comms plan with exec briefing at T-1 and T+1; dedicated launch channel from T-30 |
| Post-launch metrics never reviewed | Team disbanded at T+1; nobody owns 30-day decision | Calendar-block the 30-day retro at kickoff; assign accountable PM in the RACI |

## Success Criteria

- All five launch artifacts (run-of-show, internal comms plan, external comms checklist, rollback plan, retro) are populated and signed off before T-7.
- Launch RACI has every cell assigned to a named individual by T-21.
- Rollback drill was successfully performed and documented by T-7.
- Go/no-go at T-3 has explicit approval from PM, Engineering, PMM, Support, Legal, and Exec Sponsor.
- Launch day runs from a single shared run-of-show with hourly cadence and single incident commander.
- Post-launch retrospective produces a 30-day decision (invest more / sustain / iterate / sunset) documented and shared with the exec sponsor.
- Zero unplanned customer-visible incidents in the first 24 hours, or any incidents have a documented timeline from detection to resolution.
