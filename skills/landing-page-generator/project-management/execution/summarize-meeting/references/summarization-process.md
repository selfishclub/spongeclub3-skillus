# Summarization Process — Methodology, Template, Troubleshooting

> Read this when producing a meeting summary: the six-step methodology, the output template, focus priorities, troubleshooting table, and success criteria. Pair with `meeting-facilitation-guide.md` and `red-flags.md`.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Capture Meeting Metadata

Record the essential context:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Date** | Meeting date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| **Time** | Start and end time with timezone |
| **Participants** | Names and roles (e.g., "Sarah Chen, Product Lead") |
| **Topic** | One-line meeting purpose |
| **Location** | Room name, video link, or "async" |

### Step 2: Extract Key Discussion Points

From the raw notes or transcript, identify the substantive topics discussed. Guidelines:

- **Summarize, do not transcribe.** Capture the essence of each topic in 1-3 bullet points.
- **Use plain language.** Avoid jargon. Anyone reading the summary should understand the points without having attended.
- **Focus on what matters.** Skip small talk, repeated points, and tangential discussions.
- **Note disagreements.** If there was significant debate, capture the key positions and how they were resolved (or not).

### Step 3: Extract Action Items

Every action item must answer three questions:

1. **Who** is responsible? (Single owner, not a team)
2. **What** specifically must they do? (Concrete, observable deliverable)
3. **By when?** (Specific date, not "soon" or "next sprint")

Format as a table:

| Due Date | Owner | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 2026-03-10 | Sarah Chen | Share revised wireframes with the design team |
| 2026-03-07 | James Park | Schedule load test for the staging environment |

**Action item quality checks:**

- Each action has exactly one owner (not "Sarah and James")
- The deliverable is specific enough to verify completion
- The due date is a calendar date, not a relative timeframe
- Actions use active verbs: "share," "schedule," "draft," "review," "decide"

### Step 4: Record Decisions

List each decision made during the meeting as a numbered item. Include enough context that someone who was not present understands the decision and its rationale.

**Format:**

1. **[Decision]** -- [Brief rationale or context]. Decided by [who].
2. **[Decision]** -- [Brief rationale or context]. Decided by [who].

**Examples:**

1. **Launch date set for April 15** -- Allows two full sprints for QA after feature freeze on March 28. Decided by steering committee.
2. **Use PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB for the analytics service** -- Team consensus based on query pattern analysis showing 80% relational queries. Decided by engineering leads.

### Step 5: Capture Open Questions

List unresolved questions that need follow-up. For each question, note who is expected to provide an answer and by when, if known.

1. Do we need a separate staging environment for the new analytics service? (James to investigate by March 10)
2. What is the budget ceiling for the Q2 marketing campaign? (Pending finance review)

### Step 6: Save and Distribute

**File naming convention:** `Meeting-Summary-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[topic-slug].md`

Examples:
- `Meeting-Summary-2026-03-04-sprint-planning.md`
- `Meeting-Summary-2026-03-04-q2-roadmap-review.md`

**Distribution:**
- Share the summary within 24 hours of the meeting.
- Send to all participants and relevant stakeholders who were not present.
- Store in the team's shared documentation space (Confluence, Notion, shared drive).

## Output Template

```markdown
# Meeting Summary

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| **Time** | [HH:MM] - [HH:MM] [TZ] |
| **Participants** | [Name, Role]; [Name, Role]; ... |
| **Topic** | [One-line meeting purpose] |

## Summary

- [Key discussion point 1]
- [Key discussion point 2]
- [Key discussion point 3]

## Action Items

| Due Date | Owner | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Name] | [Specific, verifiable action] |

## Decisions Made

1. **[Decision]** -- [Rationale]. Decided by [who].

## Open Questions

1. [Question]? ([Who is expected to answer, by when])
```

## What to Focus On

When summarizing, prioritize:

- **Decisions that affect roadmap or strategy** -- These have the broadest impact and are most likely to be referenced later.
- **Who does what by when** -- Accountability is the primary value of a meeting summary.
- **Blockers and risks surfaced** -- These need visibility beyond the meeting room.
- **Changes to previously agreed plans** -- These create confusion if not documented.

When summarizing, deprioritize:

- Status updates that are available elsewhere (Jira, dashboards)
- Repetition of information already documented
- Social conversation and small talk
- Detailed technical discussions better captured in design docs

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Action items are assigned to teams instead of individuals | Culture avoids individual accountability; facilitator does not press for a single owner | Enforce the "one owner" rule during the meeting; if a team is named, ask "Who on that team is the single point of contact?" |
| Summaries are too long and nobody reads them | Summarizer includes too much detail; tries to capture everything | Apply the "would someone who missed the meeting need this?" filter to every bullet point; target 1 page maximum for 1-hour meetings |
| Decisions are not documented, leading to re-litigation in future meetings | Meeting moved quickly; facilitator focused on discussion, not decisions | Pause after each decision and state it aloud: "Let me confirm: we decided X because Y"; add decision capture as a facilitator checklist item |
| Action items have vague due dates ("soon", "next sprint") | Facilitator does not push for specificity; team uncomfortable committing to dates | Require a calendar date for every action; if the team cannot commit, set a date to decide the date |
| Summaries are distributed days after the meeting | Summarizer is overburdened or perfectionist | Set a 24-hour distribution rule; use a structured template to reduce writing effort; assign summary responsibility before the meeting |
| Open questions from previous meetings are never resolved | No follow-up mechanism; questions captured but not tracked | Add "Previous Open Questions" as a standing agenda item; assign each question an owner and a resolution date |
| Attendees disagree with the summary after distribution | Summary reflects summarizer's interpretation, not group consensus | Share key decisions and action items verbally at the meeting close; invite corrections within 24 hours of distribution |

## Success Criteria

- 100% of meetings with decisions or action items produce a written summary within 24 hours
- Every action item has a single named owner and a specific calendar due date
- Action item completion rate exceeds 80% by the stated due date
- Summaries are 1 page or less for meetings under 1 hour
- Decisions are documented with enough context that a non-attendee can understand the rationale
- Open questions from previous meetings are tracked and resolved within 2 meeting cycles
- Meeting summary satisfaction (from periodic team survey) averages 4+/5
