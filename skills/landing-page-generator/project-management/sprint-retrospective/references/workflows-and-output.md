# Sprint Retrospective — Workflows & Output

> Read this for the five core analysis workflows, tool flag tables, time-window guidance, the session/code-health/collaboration deep dives, state persistence & trend tracking, narrative generation guidelines, output examples, CI/CD integration, troubleshooting, success criteria, and the full Python tool reference.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Sprint Velocity Analysis

Analyze throughput, cycle time, and delivery patterns across the sprint window.

```bash
# Default: last 7 days
python scripts/velocity_analyzer.py

# Custom range
python scripts/velocity_analyzer.py --since 2026-03-04 --until 2026-03-18

# Compare against previous period
python scripts/velocity_analyzer.py --days 14 --compare-previous

# JSON output for pipeline
python scripts/velocity_analyzer.py --days 14 --format json
```

**Metrics computed:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total Commits | Raw commit count in window |
| LOC Added / Removed / Net | Lines of code delta |
| PRs Merged | Pull requests merged (via merge commit detection) |
| Avg PR Size | Average lines changed per PR |
| Throughput | Commits per day |
| Cycle Time | Avg time from first commit on branch to merge |
| Lead Time | Avg time from commit to production (main branch) |
| Deploy Frequency | Merges to main per day |
| Commit Type Breakdown | feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore distribution |
| Hourly Distribution | Commit activity by hour of day |

**Session Detection:**

The analyzer detects work sessions using configurable gap thresholds:

| Session Type | Duration | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Deep Work | >50 min | Sustained focused coding |
| Focused | 20-50 min | Standard development sessions |
| Micro | <20 min | Quick fixes, reviews, hotfixes |

Gap threshold default: 45 minutes. Commits within the gap belong to the same session.

**Trend Comparison:**

When `--compare-previous` is enabled, the tool compares the current window against the immediately preceding window of equal length and computes deltas with directional indicators.

### 2. Contributor Deep Dive

Per-person analysis of contributions, work patterns, and specialization areas.

```bash
# All contributors, last 14 days
python scripts/contributor_insights.py --days 14

# Single contributor focus
python scripts/contributor_insights.py --days 14 --author "jane@example.com"

# Include collaboration metrics
python scripts/contributor_insights.py --days 14 --collaboration
```

**Per-contributor metrics:**

- Commits, LOC added/removed, files touched
- Peak working hours (hourly heatmap)
- Session analysis (deep work ratio, session count)
- Focus areas by directory and file type
- Specialization detection: frontend / backend / infrastructure / docs / tests / data
- Consistency score (how evenly distributed are commits across the sprint)
- Collaboration: co-authored commits, cross-directory work

**Specialization Detection Rules:**

| Category | File Patterns |
|----------|--------------|
| Frontend | `*.tsx, *.jsx, *.vue, *.svelte, *.css, *.scss, *.html` |
| Backend | `*.py, *.go, *.rs, *.java, *.rb, *.php, *.cs` |
| Infrastructure | `Dockerfile, *.yml, *.yaml, terraform/*, k8s/*, .github/*` |
| Documentation | `*.md, *.rst, *.txt, docs/*` |
| Tests | `*test*, *spec*, __tests__/*` |
| Data | `*.sql, *.json, *.csv, migrations/*` |

### 3. Code Quality Trends

Identify churn hotspots, refactoring candidates, and code health indicators.

```bash
# Churn analysis
python scripts/code_churn_analyzer.py --days 14

# Top 20 hotspots
python scripts/code_churn_analyzer.py --days 14 --top 20

# Filter by directory
python scripts/code_churn_analyzer.py --days 14 --path src/

# Detect oscillation (files changed back and forth)
python scripts/code_churn_analyzer.py --days 14 --detect-oscillation
```

**Code Health Indicators:**

| Indicator | Calculation | Healthy Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Churn Rate | Changes per file per day | <0.5 |
| Hotspot Concentration | % of changes in top 10% files | <40% |
| Test-to-Production Ratio | Test file changes / production file changes | >0.3 |
| Refactor Frequency | refactor commits / total commits | 10-25% |
| Oscillation Score | Files with >3 change-revert cycles | <5% of files |
| Directory Spread | Unique directories changed / total directories | Context-dependent |

**Hotspot Analysis:**

Files are ranked by a composite score: `changes * unique_authors * recency_weight`. High scores indicate files that are:
- Changed frequently (unstable or central)
- Touched by multiple people (potential conflict zone)
- Recently active (not historical noise)

### 4. Team Health Assessment

Evaluate collaboration patterns, review dynamics, and knowledge distribution.

```bash
# Team health from contributor data
python scripts/contributor_insights.py --days 14 --collaboration --format json
```

**Collaboration Metrics:**

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Review Coverage | % of PRs with at least one review | >90% |
| Cross-team PRs | PRs touching multiple team areas | Healthy: 10-30% |
| Knowledge Distribution | Files touched by only 1 person | <30% (bus factor) |
| Review Turnaround | Avg time from PR open to first review | <4 hours |
| Co-authored Commits | Commits with Co-authored-by trailers | Context-dependent |

**Bus Factor Analysis:**

For each directory, the tool computes how many contributors have touched files. Directories with only 1 contributor are flagged as knowledge silos.

### 5. Improvement Tracking

Track action items from previous retrospectives and measure follow-through.

```bash
# Generate report with action item tracking
python scripts/retro_report_generator.py \
  --velocity velocity.json \
  --contributors contributors.json \
  --churn churn.json \
  --previous-retro retro_sprint_22.md \
  --sprint-name "Sprint 23"

# Compare two sprints
python scripts/retro_report_generator.py \
  --velocity velocity_current.json \
  --contributors contributors_current.json \
  --churn churn_current.json \
  --previous-velocity velocity_previous.json \
  --sprint-name "Sprint 23"
```

The report generator extracts action items from previous retro reports (marked with `- [ ]` or `- [x]`) and includes a follow-through section showing completion status.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Key Flags |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `velocity_analyzer.py` | Sprint throughput, cycle time, sessions | `--days`, `--since/--until`, `--compare-previous`, `--gap-minutes` |
| `contributor_insights.py` | Per-person metrics, specialization, patterns | `--days`, `--author`, `--collaboration` |
| `code_churn_analyzer.py` | File hotspots, churn rate, oscillation | `--days`, `--top`, `--path`, `--detect-oscillation` |
| `retro_report_generator.py` | Markdown report generation | `--velocity`, `--contributors`, `--churn`, `--previous-retro` |

All tools support:
- `--format text|json` (default: text)
- `--days N` for time window (default: 7)
- `--since YYYY-MM-DD --until YYYY-MM-DD` for custom ranges
- `--repo /path/to/repo` to analyze a specific repository (default: cwd)

## Time Windows

| Window | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| 7 days | Weekly retrospectives, iteration reviews |
| 14 days | Standard 2-week sprint retrospectives |
| 30 days | Monthly health checks, PI reviews |
| Custom range | Release retrospectives, incident post-mortems |
| Sprint comparison | Progress tracking between sprints |

## Session Analysis Deep Dive

Session detection uses timestamp gaps between consecutive commits by the same author:

1. Sort commits by author and timestamp
2. If gap between consecutive commits > threshold (default 45min), start new session
3. Classify session by total duration
4. Compute per-author session profile

**Why this matters:** A team doing 90% micro-sessions may be context-switching too much. A healthy ratio is roughly 40% deep work, 40% focused, 20% micro.

## Code Health Deep Dive

Churn analysis identifies:

- **Hotspots**: Files changed most frequently — candidates for refactoring or splitting
- **Oscillation**: Files where lines are added then removed repeatedly — signals unclear requirements or design churn
- **Test Coverage Proxy**: Ratio of test file changes to production file changes — declining ratio signals growing tech debt
- **Refactor Signal**: High proportion of `refactor:` commits in a file indicates active improvement

## Team Collaboration Deep Dive

Knowledge distribution analysis flags:

- **Single-owner files**: Only one person has ever modified them — bus factor risk
- **High-contention files**: Many authors, frequent changes — coordination overhead
- **Cross-boundary work**: Commits spanning multiple directories — integration work

## State Persistence & Trend Tracking

### Snapshot Storage
Save retro data after each sprint for historical comparison:

```bash
# Save sprint snapshot (auto-names by sprint)
python scripts/retro_report_generator.py -v velocity.json -c contributors.json -u churn.json \
  -s "Sprint 23" --save .retro-history/

# Compare two sprints
python scripts/retro_report_generator.py -v velocity.json -c contributors.json -u churn.json \
  -s "Sprint 24" --previous-velocity .retro-history/sprint-23-velocity.json
```

**Storage:** `.retro-history/{sprint-name}-{type}.json` — velocity, contributors, churn snapshots per sprint.

### Trend Analysis
After 3+ sprints, the report generator includes:
- **Velocity trajectory** — throughput and cycle time trending up, down, or stable
- **Sprint-over-sprint deltas** — percentage changes with directional indicators
- **Streak tracking** — consecutive sprints with improving velocity, shrinking cycle time, or growing test ratio
- **Attention alerts** — categories that degraded 3+ sprints in a row

### Action Item Carry-Over
The report generator parses previous retro reports for unchecked action items:
- Scans `- [ ]` checkboxes in prior `.retro-history/` markdown files
- Carries forward incomplete items into the new report's "Outstanding Actions" section
- Tracks completion rate: "3 of 5 action items from Sprint 22 completed (60%)"

## Narrative Generation Guidelines

A retrospective report is not a data dump — it tells the story of the sprint.

### Structure
1. **Tweetable summary** (1 sentence) — the sprint in a tweet. Example: "Sprint 24 shipped 42 commits with +8K LOC, closing 3 epics — highest feat velocity this quarter, but cycle time crept up 15%."
2. **Executive summary** (2-3 sentences) — data-driven, actionable, no filler
3. **Velocity dashboard** — metrics table with deltas vs previous
4. **Commit type distribution** — ASCII bar chart
5. **Work session analysis** — deep/focused/micro breakdown with implications
6. **Contributor spotlights** — per-person metrics, specialization, peak hours
7. **Code health indicators** — churn rate, hotspots, test ratio, refactor frequency
8. **Action items** — 3-5 specific, measurable improvements for next sprint
9. **Outstanding actions** — carry-over from previous retros

### Tone Guidelines
- **Celebratory for wins** — "Highest feature velocity in 4 sprints" not "Feature velocity increased"
- **Constructive for improvements** — "Cycle time crept up, suggesting review bottleneck" not "Cycle time is bad"
- **Never blame-oriented** — Frame around systems and processes, not individuals
- **Data-dense** — Every claim backed by a specific number. No "we shipped a lot" — say "42 commits, +8,247 LOC"
- **Word count target** — 1500-3000 words for a full report. Enough depth to be actionable, short enough to be read.

## Integration Points (with code)

### With Scrum Master Skill (`project-management/scrum-master/`)

```bash
# Use scrum-master capacity data alongside retro velocity
python scripts/velocity_analyzer.py --repo . --days 14 -f json > velocity.json
# Cross-reference with sprint capacity planning
python ../scrum-master/scripts/sprint_capacity_calculator.py team.json
```

### With Senior PM Skill (`project-management/senior-pm/`)

```bash
# Feed retro insights into stakeholder reports
python scripts/retro_report_generator.py -v velocity.json -c contributors.json -u churn.json -s "Sprint 24" -o retro.md
# Reference in PM executive reporting via senior-pm stakeholder tools
```

### With Delivery Manager Skill (`project-management/delivery-manager/`)

```bash
# Retro metrics inform release planning
# Velocity trends help delivery managers forecast sprint capacity
python scripts/velocity_analyzer.py --days 30 --compare-previous -f json
```

### With Agile Coach Skill (`project-management/agile-coach/`)

The agile coach uses retro trend data to identify systemic patterns:
- Declining deep work sessions → suggest focus time blocks
- Rising cycle time → investigate review process
- Low test ratio → recommend TDD adoption sprint

# Sprint Retrospective — Sprint 24

> Sprint 24 shipped 42 commits with +2.8K LOC across 14 PRs — strongest
> feature velocity this quarter, but cycle time crept up 15% suggesting
> a review bottleneck.

## Executive Summary
This sprint delivered 42 commits across 3 contributors, merging 14 PRs
with a net change of +2,847 lines. Feature work dominated at 42% of commits.
Cycle time increased to 18.3 hours (+2h vs Sprint 23), correlating with
larger average PR sizes in the auth migration epic.

## Velocity Dashboard
| Metric          | Sprint 24 | Sprint 23 | Delta   |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Commits         | 42        | 38        | +10.5%  |
| LOC Net         | +2,847    | +2,996    | -5.0%   |
| PRs Merged      | 14        | 12        | +16.7%  |
| Cycle Time      | 18.3h     | 16.1h     | +13.7%  |

## Action Items
- [ ] Investigate review bottleneck — cycle time up 2h
- [ ] Split src/api/routes.ts — highest churn file (12 changes)
- [ ] Increase test ratio — currently 0.08, target 0.15
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| velocity_analyzer.py returns zero commits | Wrong date range, repo not fetched with full history, or branch filter excluding commits | Verify `--since`/`--until` dates; ensure `git fetch --all` was run; check `--repo` path points to a valid git repo |
| Session detection shows 100% micro sessions | Session gap threshold too low, or all commits are atomic (one-line changes) | Increase `--gap-minutes` from 45 to 60-90; micro-heavy patterns may genuinely indicate context-switching |
| Contributor specialization shows "other" for all files | File extensions not matching any SPECIALIZATION_PATTERNS category | Check if your codebase uses non-standard extensions; the tool classifies by extension and path patterns |
| Code churn hotspots dominated by generated files | Auto-generated files (lock files, builds, migrations) inflate churn scores | Use `--path src/` to filter to source code, or add generated file patterns to .gitignore |
| Retro report generator produces empty sections | Input JSON files contain `{}` or data keys do not match expected schema | Verify velocity JSON has `total_commits`, `loc`, `sessions` keys; run individual tools first to confirm output |
| Previous action items not detected in carry-over | Action items in prior retro not formatted as `- [ ]` or `- [x]` markdown checkboxes | Ensure previous retro follows the standard checkbox format; the parser requires `- [ ]` prefix |
| Cycle time estimate is zero or unrealistically low | No merge commits found in the period, or all work merged via squash without branch history | Cycle time requires merge commits; squash-merge workflows lose branch-to-merge timing data |

## Success Criteria

- Retrospective reports consistently generated within 5 minutes of sprint end using the 4-tool pipeline
- Velocity trends tracked over 3+ sprints with sprint-over-sprint delta comparison
- Code churn hotspots identified and addressed, reducing top-file churn rate below 0.5/day
- Test-to-production ratio maintained above 0.3 (healthy range)
- Deep work session ratio maintained above 30% of total sessions
- Action item completion rate from previous retros tracked and exceeds 60%
- Bus factor risks (single-owner directories) reduced sprint-over-sprint
