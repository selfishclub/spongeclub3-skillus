# EU AI Act Readiness Checklist

Detailed punch list per AI Act requirement. For each item: applicability, evidence required, common gap.

---

## Step 1: System classification

Before any other readiness work, classify each AI system.

### Classification decision tree

```
Does the system fall in Annex I prohibited list?
├── Yes → CANNOT DEPLOY
└── No → continue

Does it fit Annex III high-risk list?
├── Yes → high-risk obligations
└── No → continue

Is it a general-purpose AI (GPAI) model?
├── Yes → GPAI provider obligations
└── No → continue

Is there a transparency obligation (interacts with humans, generates content, emotion recognition, biometric categorization)?
├── Yes → limited-risk obligations
└── No → minimal-risk (voluntary code of conduct)
```

### Annex III high-risk areas (8 categories)

1. Biometric identification (real-time + post-event)
2. Critical infrastructure (transport, water, energy)
3. Education and vocational training (admissions, evaluations)
4. Employment (recruitment, evaluation, work allocation)
5. Access to essential services (creditworthiness, eligibility for benefits)
6. Law enforcement (risk assessment, evidence analysis)
7. Migration, asylum, border control
8. Administration of justice and democratic processes

If your system is in any of these AND used in EU OR affecting EU persons, high-risk obligations apply.

---

## Quality Management System (Article 17)

| Item | Evidence | Common gap |
|------|----------|------------|
| QMS documented | QMS manual / procedures | Not formalized for AI |
| Compliance strategy | Documented | Implicit only |
| Techniques + procedures for development | Per development stage | Not documented |
| Testing strategy | Per system | Ad-hoc |

---

## Conformity Assessment (Article 43, Annex VII)

Two paths for high-risk systems:

| Path | When |
|------|------|
| **Internal control** (Annex VI) | For systems based on harmonized standards or common specifications; many systems |
| **Third-party (notified body)** (Annex VII) | For biometric ID; some safety-critical; voluntary for others |

### Pre-assessment readiness

- Technical documentation complete
- QMS documented and operating
- Conformity assessment procedure followed
- Internal records ready
- Self-declaration drafted (for internal control path)
- Notified body engaged (for third-party path)

### Post-assessment

- EU Declaration of Conformity signed
- CE marking applied (where applicable)
- Registration in EU database (Article 71)

## Post-Market Monitoring (Article 72)

| Item | Evidence | Common gap |
|------|----------|------------|
| Post-market monitoring plan | Documented plan | Not documented |
| Active monitoring | Monitoring tool / process | Reactive only |

## Cheat sheet

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| First step? | Classify the system (Annex III check) |
| When is the deadline? | High-risk: Aug 2026; GPAI: Aug 2025 |
| Notified body required? | For biometric ID; voluntary for most others (use internal control) |
| What's most overlooked? | Article 4 AI literacy training; Article 50 user disclosure |
| Risk management timing? | Continuous; not one-time |
| Most common misclassification? | Treating system as limited-risk when in Annex III scope |
| AI Act vs GDPR? | Both apply; GDPR governs personal data; AI Act governs the AI system |
| AI Act vs ISO 42001? | AI Act is regulation; ISO 42001 is voluntary standard for AI management system |
