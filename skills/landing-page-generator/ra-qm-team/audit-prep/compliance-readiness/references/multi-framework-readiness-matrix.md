## Auditor coordination

### Same auditor for multiple frameworks

Some firms cover multiple frameworks (SOC 2 + ISO 27001 + PCI-DSS). Benefits:
- Single relationship
- Reduced briefing overhead
- Coordinated audit schedules

Drawbacks:
- Independence concerns (single firm too embedded)
- Concentration risk if firm has issues

### Different auditors

Different firms for different frameworks. Benefits:
- Specialization (PCI QSA vs SOC 2 CPA vs ISO 27001 certification body)
- Independence

Drawbacks:
- More relationships to manage
- Audit weeks not coordinated (multiple disruptions)

## Cheat sheet

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Start with which? | Customer-demanded; often SOC 2 Type I |
| SOC 2 vs ISO 27001? | If selling US enterprise: SOC 2 first; if global: ISO 27001 |
| When to add second framework? | After first is operational; substantial overlap with SOC 2 + ISO 27001 |
| Same auditor for SOC 2 + ISO 27001? | Possible; depends on firm; some specialize in one |
| How long for SOC 2 Type I from scratch? | 3-6 months |
| How long for ISO 27001 from scratch? | 6-12 months |
| Shared evidence rate? | 60-80% overlap between SOC 2 + ISO 27001 |
| Multi-framework GRC tool needed? | At 3+ frameworks; complexity overhead justifies |
