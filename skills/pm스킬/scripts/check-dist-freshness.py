"""Fail when the committed catalog/ and dist/ shelf have drifted from skills/.

Why this exists
---------------
`check-library-drift.py` verifies marketplace.json and doc links. It does NOT
look at `catalog/` or `dist/`, so the library could pass CI completely green
while the browsable download shelf still advertised the previous release. That
happened between v0.83 and v0.84 and was caught by hand.

Why it is not part of validate-skills.sh
----------------------------------------
`build-dist.sh` calls `build-release.sh`, which calls `validate-skills.sh`. If
this check lived there, the very command you run to FIX staleness would abort
before regenerating anything. So it is a standalone script, wired into CI as its
own step and run by hand before committing a skill change.

Checks are deliberately content-level, never byte-level: rebuilt ZIPs differ on
every run because of embedded timestamps, so comparing archive bytes would fail
constantly and teach everyone to ignore it.
